https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/12,Google-Landmarks Dataset,"Did you ever go through your vacation photos and ask yourself: What is the name of this temple I visited in China? Who created this monument I saw in France? Landmark recognition can help! This technology can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections. Today, a great obstacle to landmark recognition research is the lack of large annotated datasets. This motivated us to release Google-Landmarks, the largest worldwide dataset to date, to foster progress in this problem.      The dataset is divided into two sets of images, to evaluate two different computer vision tasks: recognition and retrieval. The data was originally described in [1], and published as part of the [Google Landmark Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-challenge) and [Google Landmark Retrieval Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-challenge).     Additionally, to spur research in this field, we have open-sourced Deep Local Features (DELF), an attentive local feature descriptor that we believe is especially suited for this kind of task. DELF\'s code can be found on github via [this link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/delf).     If you make use of this dataset in your research, please consider citing:     `H. Noh, A. Araujo, J. Sim, T. Weyand, B. Han, ""Large-Scale Image Retrieval with Attentive Deep Local Features"", Proc. ICCV\'17`      Challenges     The two challenges associated to this dataset can be found in the following links:     * [Google Landmark Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-challenge)    * [Google Landmark Retrieval Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-challenge)      CVPR\'18 Workshop     The [Landmark Recognition Workshop](https://landmarkscvprw18.github.io) at [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/program/workshops) will discuss recent progress on landmark recognition and image retrieval, taking into account the results of the above-mentioned challenges. Top submissions for the challenges will be invited to give talks at the workshop.       Content     The dataset contains URLs of images which are publicly available online (this [Python script](https://www.kaggle.com/tobwey/landmark-recognition-challenge-image-downloader) may be useful to download the images). Note that no image data is released, only URLs.      The dataset contains test images, training images and index images. The test images are used in both tasks: for the recognition task, a landmark label may be predicted for each test image; for the retrieval task, relevant index images may be retrieved for each test image. The training images are associated to landmark labels, and can be used to train models for the recognition and retrieval challenges (for a visualization of the geographic distribution of training images, see [2]). The index images are used in the retrieval task, composing the set from which images should be retrieved.     Note that the test set for both the recognition and retrieval tasks is the same, to encourage researchers to experiment with both. We also encourage participants to use the training data from the recognition task to train models which could be useful for the retrieval task. Note, however, that there are no landmarks in common between the training/index sets of the two tasks.     The images listed in the dataset are not directly in our control, so their availability may change over time, and the dataset files may be updated to remove URLs which no longer work.      Dataset construction     The training and index sets were constructed by clustering photos with respect to their geolocation and visual similarity using an algorithm similar to the one described in [3]. Matches between training images were established using local feature matching. Note that there may be multiple clusters per landmark, which typically correspond to different views or different parts of the landmark. To avoid bias, no computer vision algorithms were used for ground truth generation. Instead, we established ground truth correspondences between test images and landmarks using human annotators.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/13,Biodiversity in National Parks," Context      The National Park Service&nbsp;publishes a database of animal and plant species identified in individual national parks and verified by evidence — observations, vouchers, or reports that document the presence of a species in a park. All park species records are available to the public on the National Park Species portal; exceptions are made for sensitive, threatened, or endangered species when widespread distribution of information could pose a risk to the species in the park.       Content     National Park species lists provide information on the presence and status of species in our national parks. These species lists are works in progress and the absence of a species from a list does not necessarily mean the species is absent from a park. The time and effort spent on species inventories varies from park to park, which may result in data gaps. Species taxonomy changes over time and reflects regional variations or preferences; therefore, records may be listed under a different species name.     Each park species record includes a species ID, park name, taxonomic information, scientific name, one or more common names, record status, occurrence (verification of species presence in park), nativeness (species native or foreign to park), abundance (presence and visibility of species in park), seasonality (season and nature of presence in park), and conservation status (species classification according to US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service). Taxonomic classes have been translated from Latin to English for species categorization; order, family, and scientific name (genus, species, subspecies) are in Latin.

This second edition is the improved and extended follow-up of the first version of the record (Stengel et al., 2014; CLAAS-1 DOI:10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/CLAAS/V001). In order to ensure a homogeneous data basis, the solar SEVIRI channels of MSG-1, MSG-2 and MSG-3 were intercalibrated (Meirink et al, 2013) with MODIS Aqua before applying the cloud retrievals. CLAAS-2 features 12 years (2004-2015) of cloud mask/type, cloud top temperature/pressure/height, cloud phase as well as cloud microphysical properties such as optical thickness, effective droplet radius and cloud water path. The data are available on native SEVIRI resolution, i.e. 15 minutes repeat cycle and 3km (nadir) to 11km (edge of the field of view) spatial resolution. In addition, spatio-temporal averages of the above mentioned cloud properties are included: Daily and monthly averages and monthly histograms on a 0.05° x 0.05° grid as well as monthly mean diurnal cycles on a 0.25° x 0.25° grid. The advancements compared to CLAAS-1 (DOI:10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/CLAAS/V001) are for example:        (1) extended MSG measurement record used with better calibration,        (2) improvements made to the retrieval algorithm leading to products with higher quality and        (3) increased temporal resolution (15 Minutes).        A summary on the CLAAS-2 characteristics and a comprehensive evaluation of the results are currently documented in Benas et al. (2016). Along with the data, a comprehensive documentation including user guide, algorithm descriptions, reprocessing layout and extensive validation studies, is provided. With CLAAS-2, regional and large scale cloud processes at temporal scales of minutes to years can be studied. SEVIRI-based surface radiation products, which were part of CLAAS-1, are now released in a separate dataset (SARAH-2).",

The tweets in this database were sent between February 2012 and May 2018, with the vast majority posted from 2015 through 2017.     FiveThirtyEight obtained the data from Clemson University researchers [Darren Linvill](https://www.clemson.edu/cbshs/faculty-staff/profiles/darrenl), an associate professor of communication, and [Patrick Warren](http://pwarren.people.clemson.edu/), an associate professor of economics, on July 25, 2018. They gathered the data using custom searches on a tool called Social Studio, owned by Salesforce and contracted for use by Clemson\'s [Social Media Listening Center](https://www.clemson.edu/cbshs/centers-institutes/smlc/).     The basis for the Twitter handles included in this data are the [November 2017](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/exhibit_b.pdf) and [June 2018](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ira_handles_june_2018.pdf) lists of Internet Research Agency-connected handles that Twitter [provided](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=396) to Congress. This data set contains every tweet sent from each of the 2,752 handles on the November 2017 list since May 10, 2015. For the 946 handles newly added on the June 2018 list, this data contains every tweet since June 19, 2015. (For certain handles, the data extends even earlier than these ranges. Some of the listed handles did not tweet during these ranges.) The researchers believe that this includes the overwhelming majority of these handles’ activity. The researchers also removed 19 handles that remained on the June 2018 list but that they deemed very unlikely to be IRA trolls.     In total, the nine CSV files include 2,973,371 tweets from 2,848 Twitter handles. Also, as always, caveat emptor -- in this case, tweet-reader beware: In addition to their own content, some of the tweets contain active links, which may lead to adult content or worse.     The Clemson researchers used this data in a working paper, [Troll Factories: The Internet Research Agency and State-Sponsored Agenda Building](http://pwarren.people.clemson.edu/Linvill_Warren_TrollFactory.pdf), which is currently under review at an academic journal. The authors’ analysis in this paper was done on the data file provided here, limiting the date window to June 19, 2015, to Dec. 31, 2017.     The files have the following columns:         Header | Definition        ---|---------        `external_author_id` | An author account ID from Twitter         `author` | The handle sending the tweet        `content` | The text of the tweet        `region` | A region classification, as [determined by Social Studio](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?   id=000199367&amp;type=1)        `language` | The language of the tweet        `publish_date` | The date and time the tweet was sent        `harvested_date` | The date and time the tweet was collected by Social Studio        `following` | The number of accounts the handle was following at the time of the tweet        `followers` | The number of followers the handle had at the time of the tweet        `updates` | The number of “update actions” on the account that authored the tweet, including tweets, retweets and likes        `post_type` | Indicates if the tweet was a retweet or a quote-tweet        `account_type` | Specific account theme, as coded by Linvill and Warren        `retweet` | A binary indicator of whether or not the tweet is a retweet        `account_category` | General account theme, as coded by Linvill and Warren        `new_june_2018` | A binary indicator of whether the handle was newly listed in June 2018     If you use this data and find anything interesting, please let us know.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/42,"Spatial distribution of a flying seabird (Antarctic petrel) and penguins (Adélie penguin, Emperor penguin) in the wider Weddell Sea (Antarctica) with links to ArcGIS map packages","Here we provide four ArcGIS map packages with georeferenced files on the spatial distribution of Antarctic petrels, Adélie penguins (breeders and non-breeders) and Emperor penguins in the wider Weddell Sea (Antarctica), which were created in the context of the development of a marine protected area in the Weddell Sea.Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica): We approximated potential foraging habitats of T. antarctica according to existing literature by ice coverage from AMSR-E sea ice maps, bathymetric data from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO), and seawater temperature data from the Finite Element Sea Ice - Ocean Model (FESOM) provided by R. Timmermann (AWI). Subsequently, we combined our Antarctic petrel model with the kernel utilization distribution model from Descamps et al. (2016). The authors kindly provided us with shape files showing the kernel utilization summer and winter distribution of Antarctic petrel breeding at Svarthamaren. Breeding locations and estimated number of breeding pairs were taken from van Franeker et al. (1999). Favourable habitat conditions for Antarctic petrels were predicted for the Lazarev Sea and along the eastern coast of the Weddell Sea, particularly for the area off the Fimbul Ice Shelf and along the coast between approx. 15°E to 10°W within a water depth range from approx. 500 m to 2500 m.Breeding Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae): The map of potential foraging habitats of breeding P. adeliae is based on British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Inventory data from Phil Trathan (ID 754) and Mike Dunn and P. Trathan (ID 764, 773, 779), a dataset from BAS (P. Trathan) and Instituto Antártico Argentino (Mercedes Santos) (ID 753) and a dataset from the US AMLR Program from Jefferson Hinke and Wayne Trivelpiece (NOAA) (ID 910), which are stored in the Birdlife International's Seabird Tracking Database (data request: 20-10-2015). Suitable foraging habitats for breeding Adélies from colonies from which no tracking data were not available were approximated by a 50 km buffer and a 50-100 km ring buffer around each colony according to the recommendations of a CCAMLR MPA planning workshop. Breeding locations and estimated abundance of breeding pairs were taken from Lynch and LaRue (2014). The tracking data were processed with a state-space model described by Johnson et al. (2008) and were implemented in the R package crawl (Johnson 2011). Jefferson Hinke (NOAA) kindly provided us with support running the R script. Highly suitable foraging habitats occurred about 50 km away from the colonies on King Georg Island, the colony in Hope Bay (Graham Land) and the colonies on the South Orkney Islands.Non-breeding Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae): The map of potential foraging habitats of non-breeding P. adeliae is based on British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Inventory data from Phil Trathan (ID 754) and Mike Dunn and P. Trathan (ID 773, 779), a dataset from BAS (P. Trathan) and Instituto Antártico Argentino (Mercedes Santos) (ID 753) and a dataset from the US AMLR Program from Jefferson Hinke and Wayne Trivelpiece (NOAA) (ID 910), which are stored in the Birdlife International's Seabird Tracking Database (data request: 20-10-2015). The tracking data were processed with a state-space model described by Johnson et al. (2008) and were implemented in the R package crawl (Johnson 2011). Jefferson Hinke (NOAA) kindly provided us with support running the R script. Highest habitat utilisation was concentrated in relative small areas (e.g., close to King Georg Island). However, the non-breeding Adélies seemed to roam through large parts of the Weddell Sea.Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri): The probability map of A. forsteri occurrence was developed as a function of distance to colony and colony size from Fretwell et al. (2012, 2014) as well as from sea ice concentration from AMSR-E sea ice maps. Our model of emperor penguin foraging distribution during breeding season showed that the probability of occurrence is highest at the Halley and Dawson colony near Brunt Ice Shelf and at the Atka colony near Ekstrøm Ice Shelf.More information on the spatial analysis is given in working paper WG-EMM-16/03 and WG-SAM-17/30 (for T. antarctica) submitted to the CCAMLR Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (EMM) and the CCAMLR Working Group on Statistics, Assessments and Modelling (SAM), respectively (available at https://www.ccamlr.org/en/wg-emm-16 and https://www.ccamlr.org/en/wg-sam-17)."," File name,  File size,  Uniform resource locator/link to file, File format,  Pygoscelis adeliae,  Aptenodytes forsteri,  Antarctica,  Thalassoica antarctica,  Functional Ecology @ AWI (AWI_FuncEco),  Development of a CCAMLR Marine Protected Area in the Antarctic Weddell Sea (WSMPA),  File content,  Weddell Sea,  Marine Protected Area (MPA)"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/46,Interactive Locomotion,"            The dataset is made up of full-body kinematics data of 6 subjects performing    two main tasks:                -  walking alone (Solo Trial);                -  walking together with another subject while mechanically coupled        through a stretcher-like object (Paired Trial).    Data were collected by using the VICON system with 14 infrared bonita camera.    Subjects were fully instrumented by 34 passive markers placed according to the    Plug-In-Gait marker placement.                           The stretcher like object used to mechanically coupled a pair of subjects was also    instrumented with 6 markers in order to detect its position during the trials.        The experiment parameters and subject metadata are provided in the files    Subject_Disposition.xlsx and Database_Subjects_CoMTrajectory.xlsx. The trajectory    of each marker placed on each subject within a pair is stored in Pair*.mat while    the trajectory and the velocity of the CoM for each subject evaluated at each gait    cycle can be found in CoM_trajectories and CoM_velocities.    In detail:             - Pair*.mat: For each pair (*=1,2,3,...,7), the cells represent the trials    performed by the pair. By opening one cell (trial) it is possible to find    several fields.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/49,Adaptive Incremental Mixture Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"We propose adaptive incremental mixture Markov chain Monte Carlo (AIMM), a novel approach to sample from challenging probability distributions defined on a general state-space. While adaptive MCMC methods usually update a parametric proposal kernel with a global rule, AIMM locally adapts a semiparametric kernel. AIMM is based on an independent Metropolis–Hastings proposal distribution which takes the form of a finite mixture of Gaussian distributions. Central to this approach is the idea that the proposal distribution adapts to the target by locally adding a mixture component when the discrepancy between the proposal mixture and the target is deemed to be too large. As a result, the number of components in the mixture proposal is not fixed in advance. Theoretically, we prove that there exists a stochastic process that can be made arbitrarily close to AIMM and that converges to the correct target distribution. We also illustrate that it performs well in practice in a variety of challenging situations, including high-dimensional and multimodal target distributions. Finally, the methodology is successfully applied to two real data examples, including the Bayesian inference of a semiparametric regression model for the Boston Housing dataset.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/51,Star Cluster Simulations," Context      Stars mostly form in clusters and associations rather than in isolation. Milky Way star clusters are easily observable with small telescopes, and in some cases even with the naked eye. Depending on a variety of conditions, star clusters may dissolve quickly or be very long lived.    The dynamical evolution of star clusters is a topic of very active research in astrophysics. Some popular models of star clusters are the so-called direct N-body simulations [1, 2], where every star is represented by a point particle that interacts gravitationally with every other particle. This kind of simulation is computationally expensive, as it scales as O(N^2) where N is the number of particles in the simulated cluster. In the following, the words ""particle"" and ""star"" are used interchangeably.      Content     This dataset contains the positions and velocities of simulated stars (particles) in a direct N-body simulation of a star cluster. In the cluster there are initially 64000 stars distributed in position-velocity space according to a King model [3]. Each .csv file named c_xxxx.csv corresponds to a snapshot of the simulation at time t = xxxx. For example, c_0000.csv contains the initial conditions (positions and velocities of stars at time t=0). Times are measured in standard N-body units [4]. This is a system of units where G = M = −4E = 1 (G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass of the cluster, and E its total energy).     **x, y, z**    Columns 1, 2, and 3 of each file are the x, y, z positions of the stars. They are also expressed in standard N-body units [4]. You can switch to units of the median radius of the cluster by finding the cluster center and calculating the median distance of stars from it, and then dividing x, y, and z by this number. In general, the median radius changes in time. The initial conditions are approximately spherically symmetric (you can check) so there is no particular physical meaning attached to the choice of x, y, and z.      **vx, vy, vz**    Columns 4, 5, and 6 contain the x, y, and z velocity, also in N-body units. A scale velocity for the stars can be obtained by taking the standard deviation of velocity along one direction (e.g. z). You may check that the ratio between the typical radius (see above) and the typical velocity is of order unity.     **m**    Column 7 is the mass of each star. For this simulation this is identically 1.5625e-05, i.e. 1/64000. The total mass of the cluster is initially 1. More realistic simulations (coming soon) have a spectrum of different masses and live stelar evolution, that results in changes in the mass of stars. This simulation is a pure N-body problem instead.     **Star id number**    The id numbers of each particle are listed in the last column (8) of the files under the header ""id"". The ids are unique and can be used to trace the position and velocity of a star across all files. There are initially 64000 particles. At end of the simulation there are 63970. This is because some particles escape the cluster.      Acknowledgements     This simulation was run on a Center for Galaxy Evolution Research (CGER) workstation at Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea), using the NBODY6 software (https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm).       Inspiration     Some stars hover around the center of the cluster, while some other get kicked out to the cluster outskirts or even leave the cluster altogether. Can we predict where a star will be at any given time based on its initial position and velocity? Can we predict its velocity?     How correlated are the motions of stars? Can we predict the velocity of a given star based on the velocity of its neighbours?     The size of the cluster can be measured by defining a center (see below) and finding the median distance of stars from it. This is called the three-dimensional effective radius. Can we predict how it evolves over time? What are its properties as a time series? What can we say about other quantiles of the radius?     How to define the cluster center? Just as the mode of a KDE of the distribution of stars? How does it move over time and how to quantify the properties of its fluctuations? Is the cluster symmetric around this center?     Some stars leave the cluster: over time they exchange energy in close encounters with other stars and reach the escape velocity. This can be seen by comparing later snapshots with the initial one: some IDs are missing and there is overall a lower number of stars. Can we predict which stars are more likely to escape? When will a given star escape?

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/52,Breast Histopathology Images," Context     Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample, pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. As a result, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact regions of IDC inside of a whole mount slide.      Content     The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50  x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive).  Each patch’s file name is of the format:  u_xX_yY_classC.png   — &gt; example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png . Where u is the patient ID (10253_idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/71,BOLD5000,"Brain, Object, Landscape DatasetVision science - particularly machine vision - is being     revolutionized by large-scale datasets. State-of-the-art artificial     vision models critically depend on large-scale datasets to achieve high     performance. In contrast, although large-scale learning models (e.g., AlexNet) have     been applied to human neuroimaging data, the stimuli for such     neuroimaging experiments include significantly fewer images. The small size of these stimulus sets also translates to limited image     diversity. Here we dramatically increase the stimulus set size deployed     in an fMRI study of visual scene processing. We scanned     four participants in a slow-evented related design that incorporated     4,916 unique scenes. Data was collected over 16 sessions, 15 of which     were task-related sessions, plus an additional session for acquiring     high resolution anatomical scans. In 8 of the 15 task-related sessions, a     functional localizer was run in order to independently define     scene-selective cortex. In each scanning session, participants filled     out a questionnaire (Daily Intake) about their daily routine, including:     current status regarding food and beverage intake, sleep, exercise, ibuprofen,     and comfort in the scanner. During BOLD scanning, physiological data     (heart rate and respiration) was also acquired.The     experiment including 4,803 images presented on a single trial     throughout the experiment, and 112 images repeated four times, and one     image repeated three times, throughout the experiment, yielding a total     of 5,254 stimuli trials. The stimuli were drawn from three datasets: 1)     1000 images from Scene Images (250 scene categories, based on SUN     categories, with four exemplars each); 2) 2000 images from the COCO     dataset; and 3) 1916 images from the ImageNet dataset. In the     experiment, images were presented for 1 second, with 9 seconds of     fixation between trials. Participants were asked to judge whether they     liked, disliked, or were neutral about the image.In sum,     our dataset is unique in three ways: it is 1) significantly larger than     existing slow-event neural datasets by an order of magnitude, 2)     extremely diverse in stimuli, 3) considerably overlapping with existing     computer vision datasets. Our large-scale dataset enables novel neural     network training and novel exploration of benchmark computer vision datasets through     neuroscience. Finally, the scale advantage of our dataset and the use     of a slow event-related design enables, for the first time, joint     computer vision and fMRI analyses that span a significant and diverse     region of image space using high-performing models.

This paper presents Flickr30k Entities, which augments the 158k captions from Flickr30k with 244k coreference chains, linking mentions of the same entities across different captions for the same image, and associating them with 276k manually annotated bounding boxes. Such annotations are essential for continued progress in automatic image description and grounded language understanding. They enable us to define a new benchmark for localization of textual entity mentions in an image. We present a strong baseline for this task that combines an image-text embedding, detectors for common objects, a color classifier, and a bias towards selecting larger objects. While our baseline rivals in accuracy more complex state-of-the-art models, we show that its gains cannot be easily parlayed into improvements on such tasks as image-sentence retrieval, thus underlining the limitations of current methods and the need for further research."," data type &gt; image data,  ComputingMethodologies_IMAGEPROCESSINGANDCOMPUTERVISION,  analysis &gt; nlp,  large, analysis &gt; image processing"

The data is also obtainable from the [Socrata Open Data Access (SODA)](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb) portal in either CSV or JSON formats. It is also made available here (unofficially, I have no official affiliation with the city of Seattle or the Seattle Animal Shelter) to help spread awareness of the dataset and Seattle's Pet Licensing initiative.      Content      Seattle Pet Licenses Dataset     The data set contains information on licenses issued as far back as 2005 to the end of January 2017.      **Dataset Columns:**     * License Issue Date: Floating Timestamp      - Date and time of when the pet license was issued.    * License Number: Integer      - Unique ID for each issued license.    * Animal's Name: String      - Name of the licensed pet.    * Species: String      - Species of the licensed pet. Will be either 'Dog,' 'Cat,' or 'Livestock.'    * Primary Breed: String      - Primary breed of the licensed pet.    * Secondary Breed: String      - Secondary breed (if any) of the licensed pet.

The uploaded data represents a clean set of data for analysis use.      Acknowledgements     The Seattle Pet Licenses dataset was compiled by the City of Seattle Department of Finance and Administrative Services through the city of Seattle's Open Data initiative, and all credit goes to the original creators and maintainers of the data, the [Seattle Animal Shelter](http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter). I am merely trying to make the data available to a broader audience to help spread awareness.     The [Statistics of Income (SOI) dataset](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi) is owned and maintained by the IRS. The data presented here is a clean representation of the Washington Zip Code SOI 2015 dataset.      Inspiration     The dataset shows there were almost no pets licensed from 2005 up until mid-2014 when volume began rising drastically, for reasons as yet unknown (in that I wasn't able to find any sources mentioning any news that would cause such a significant increase). There also appears to be a massive disparity in the number of dogs licensed compared to cats, even though there are approximately 5 million more owned cats in the United States over dogs. Thus, I hope that by making this data more available, users who analyze the data can find insights and recommendations for the Seattle Animal Shelter to increase pet licensing numbers and help show pet owners who haven't licensed their pets why it is essential.

Earth System Science Data, 9(2), 615-638","The objective of the study is to provide global grids (0.5°) of revised annual coefficients for the Priestley-Taylor (P-T) and Hargreaves-Samani (H-S) evapotranspiration methods after calibration based on the ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers)-standardized Penman-Monteith method (the ASCE method includes two reference crops: short-clipped grass and tall alfalfa). The analysis also includes the development of a global grid of revised annual coefficients for solar radiation (Rs) estimations using the respective Rs formula of H-S. The analysis was based on global gridded climatic data of the period 1950-2000. The method for deriving annual coefficients of the P-T and H-S methods was based on partial weighted averages (PWAs) of their mean monthly values. This method estimates the annual values considering the amplitude of the parameter under investigation (ETo and Rs) giving more weight to the monthly coefficients of the months with higher ETo values (or Rs values for the case of the H-S radiation formula). The method also eliminates the effect of unreasonably high or low monthly coefficients that may occur during periods where ETo and Rs fall below a specific threshold. The new coefficients were validated based on data from 140 stations located in various climatic zones of the USA and Australia with expanded observations up to 2016. The validation procedure for ETo estimations of the short reference crop showed that the P-T and H-S methods with the new revised coefficients outperformed the standard methods reducing the estimated root mean square error (RMSE) in ETo values by 40 and 25 %, respectively. The estimations of Rs using the H-S formula with revised coefficients reduced the RMSE by 28 % in comparison to the standard H-S formula. Finally, a raster database was built consisting of (a) global maps for the mean monthly ETo values estimated by ASCE-standardized method for both reference crops, (b) global maps for the revised annual coefficients of the P-T and H-S evapotranspiration methods for both reference crops and a global map for the revised annual coefficient of the H-S radiation formula and (c) global maps that indicate the optimum locations for using the standard P-T and H-S methods and their possible annual errors based on reference values. The database can support estimations of ETo and solar radiation for locations where climatic data are limited and it can support studies which require such estimations on larger scales (e.g. country, continent, world). The datasets produced in this study are archived in the PANGAEA database (this data set) and in the ESRN database (http://www.esrn-database.org or http://esrn-database.weebly.com)."," File name,  File size,  Uniform resource locator/link to file, File format,  File content,  Analytical method,  ORDINAL NUMBER,  Comment"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/85,Study 1 stimuli,"Dataset connected with article: 'Increasing the use of conceptually-derived strategies in arithmetic: using inversion problems to promote the use of associativity shortcuts.' Abstract: Conceptual knowledge of key principles underlying arithmetic is an important precursor to understanding algebra and later success in mathematics. One such principle is associativity, which allows individuals to solve problems in different ways by decomposing and recombining subexpressions (e.g. ‘a + b – c’ = ‘b – c + a’). More than any other principle, children and adults alike have difficulty understanding it, and educators have called for this to change. We report three intervention studies that were conducted in university classrooms to investigate whether adults’ use of associativity could be improved. In all three studies, it was found that those who first solved inversion problems (e.g. ‘a + b – b’) were more likely than controls to then use associativity on ‘a + b – c’ problems. We suggest that ‘a + b – b’ inversion problems may either direct spatial attention to the location of ‘b – c’ on associativity problems, or implicitly communicate the validity and efficiency of a right-to-left strategy. These findings may be helpful for those designing brief activities that aim to aid the understanding of arithmetic principles and algebra.",170299 Cognitive Science not elsewhere classified
https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/86,How many samples are needed to prove the absence of contamination - an example using arsenic?,"If a change of use for industrial land is proposed in the UK, there is usually a requirement to demonstrate that the change of use will not result in the land becoming Contaminated Land, as defined under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Under certain circumstances, this demonstration can be made by showing that the mean concentration of contaminants of potential concern is below a suitable assessment level appropriate to the proposed new use. How much sampling effort is required for this purpose? Using a relatively large dataset for arsenic in soil, a developed approach is presented to determining the number of measurements required for a clearance investigation to demonstrate absence of contamination based on minimizing expectation of financial loss, taking into account both the actual cost of investigation and the possible cost of incorrectly determining that contamination is still present and undertaking unnecessary remediation.

Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21(2), 805-820","Subgrid variability introduces non-negligible scale effects on the GIS-based representation of snow. This heterogeneity is even more evident in semiarid regions, where the high variability of the climate produces various accumulation melting cycles throughout the year and a large spatial heterogeneity of the snow cover. This variability in a watershed can often be represented by snow depletion curves (DCs). In this study, terrestrial photography (TP) of a cell-sized area (30 x 30 m) was used to define local snow DCs at a Mediterranean site. Snow cover fraction (SCF) and snow depth (h) values obtained with this technique constituted the two datasets used to define DCs. A flexible sigmoid function was selected to parameterize snow behaviour on this subgrid scale. It was then fitted to meet five different snow patterns in the control area: one for the accumulation phase and four for the melting phase in a cycle within the snow season. Each pattern was successfully associated with the snow conditions and previous evolution. The resulting DCs were able to capture certain physical features of the snow, which were used in a decision-tree and included in the point snow model formulated by Herrero et al. (2009). The final performance of this model was tested against field observations recorded over four hydrological years (2009?2013). The calibration and validation of this DC-snow model was found to have a high level of accuracy with global RMSE values of 84.2 mm for the average snow depth and 0.18 m**2/m**2 for the snow cover fraction in the control area. The use of DCs on the cell scale proposed in this research provided a sound basis for the extension of point snow models to larger areas by means of a gridded distributed calculation.","Snow thickness,  Snow cover fraction,  DATE/TIME,  Digital camera CC640"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/105,Optimized implementations of voxel-wise degree centrality and local functional connectivity density mapping in AFNI,"Degree centrality (DC) and local functional connectivity density (lFCD) are statistics calculated from brain connectivity graphs that measure how important a brain region is to the graph. DC (a.k.a. global functional connectivity density) is calculated as the number of connections a region has with the rest of the brain (binary DC), or the sum of weights for those connections (weighted DC). lFCD was developed to be a surrogate measure of DC that is faster to calculate by restricting its computation to regions that are spatially adjacent. Although both of these measures are popular for investigating inter-individual variation in brain connectivity, efficient neuroimaging tools for computing them are scarce. The goal of this Brainhack project was to contribute optimized implementations of these algorithms to the widely used, open source, AFNI software package. Tools for calculating DC (3dDegreeCentrality) and lFCD (3dLFCD) were implemented by modifying the C source code of AFNI’s 3dAutoTcorrelate tool. 3dAutoTcorrelate calculates the voxel voxel correlation matrix for a dataset and includes most of the functionality we require, including support for OpenMP multithreading to improve calculation time, the ability to restrict the calculation using a user-supplied or auto-calculated mask, and support for both Pearson’s and Spearman correlation. Outputs from the newly developed tools were benchmarked to Python implementations of these measures from the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) using the publically shared Intrinsic Brain Activity Test-Retest (IBATRT) dataset from the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility."," Neuroscience, Imaging"

Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute ""first date"" with every other participant of the opposite sex.  At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.      The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.

Users are advised to transition to this updated dataset.      This dataset contains Version 2.2 of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) combined satellite-gauge precipitation estimate and combined satellite-gauge error estimate. The data are monthly analyses defined on a global 2.5 degree by 2.5 degree longitude/latitude grid and cover the period January 1979 to (delayed) present. A monthly climatology (1979-2011) is also available.      Please note that the original binary data were written using the big endian representation of unformatted binary words. Users reading this data on little endian platforms, therefore, will need to byte swap the data.      The GPCP was established by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and subsequently attached to the Global Energy and Water Exchange program (GEWEX) to address the problem of quantifying the distribution of precipitation around the globe over many years. The general approach is to combine the precipitation information available from each of several sources into a final merged product, taking advantage of the strengths of each data type. The passive microwave estimates are based on Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) data from the series of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP, United States) satellites that fly in sun-synchronous low-earth orbits at 6am / 6pm. The infrared precipitation estimates are computed primarily from geostationary satellites (United States, Europe, Japan), and secondarily from NOAA series polar-orbiting satellites (United States). Additional low-Earth orbit estimates include Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data from the NASA Aqua, and Television Infrared Observation Satellite Program (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Outgoing Longwave Radiation Precipitation Index (OPI) data from the NOAA series satellites. The precipitation gauge data are assembled and analyzed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) of the Deutscher Wetterdienst.      The Version 2.2 Data Set contains data from the following contributing centers:            * GPCP Polar Satellite Precipitation Data Centre - Emission (SSM/I and SSMIS emission estimates)           * GPCP Polar Satellite Precipitation Data Centre - Scattering (SSM/I and SSMIS scattering estimates)           *  GPCP Geostationary Satellite Precipitation Data Centre (GPI and OPI estimates)           *  NASA/GSFC Sounder Research Team (TOVS and AIRS estimates)           *  GPCP Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (precipitation gauge analyses)     Request to users from the data authors: The GPCP datasets are developed and maintained with international cooperation and are used by the worldwide scientific community. To better understand the evolving requirements across the GPCP user community and to increase the utility of the GPCP product suite, the dataset authors request that a citation be provided for each publication that uses the GPCP products. Please email the citation to george.j.huffman@nasa.gov or david.t.bolvin@nasa.gov.

The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/138,"Who starts and who debunks rumors', 'Webpages cited by rumor trackers"," Context      [Emergent.info](http://www.emergent.info/) was a major rumor tracker, created by veteran journalist [Craig Silverman](https://twitter.com/CraigSilverman). It has been defunct for a while, but its well-structured format and well-documented content provides an opportunity for analyzing rumors on the web.      [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/) is one of the oldest rumors trackers on the web. Originally launched by Barbara and David Mikkelson, it is now run by a team of editors who investigate urban legends, myths, viral rumors and fake news. The investigators try to provide a detailed explanation for why they have chosen to confirm or debunk a rumor, often citing several web pages and other external sources.      [Politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/) is a fact-checker that is focused on statements made by politicians and claims circulated by political campaigns, blogs and similar websites. Politifact\'s labels range from ""true,"" to ""pants on fire!""       ---      Content     This dataset consists of three files. One file is a collection of all webpages cited in Emergent.info, and the second is a collection of webpages cited in Snopes.com, and the third is a similar collection from Politifact.com. The webpages were often cited because they had started a rumor, shared a rumor, or debunked a rumor.      Emergent.info    Emergent.info often provides a clean timeline of the rumor\'s propagation on the web, and identifies which page was for the rumor, which page was against it, and which page was simply observing it. Please refer to the image below to learn more about the fields in this dataset.     ![The image displays a sample post from Emergent.info and highlights the corresponding fields in emergent.csv.][1]     Snopes.com    The structure of posts on **Snopes.com** is not as well-defined. Please refer to the image below to learn more about the fields in the Snopes dataset.     ![This image displays a sample post from Snopes.com and highlights the corresponding fields in snopes.csv.][2]     Politifact.com    Similar to Emergent.info, Politifact.com follows a well-structured format in reporting and documenting rumors. There is a sidebar on the right side of each page that lists all of the sources cited within the page. The top link is the likeliest to be the original source of the rumor. For this link, page_is_first_citation is set to true.      ![This image displays a sample post from Politifact.com and highlights the corresponding fields in politifact.csv.][3]     ---      Inspiration     I created this dataset in order to study domains that frequently start, propagate, or debunk rumors. By studying these domains and people who follow them, I hope to gain some insight into the dynamics of rumor propagation on the web, as well as social media.      ---      Notes/Disclaimer     When using the Snopes dataset, please keep the following in mind:      * In addition to debunking rumors, Snopes.com occasionally reports news and other types of content. This collection only includes data from ""[Fact Check](http://www.snopes.com/category/facts)"" posts on Snopes.         * Snopes.com was launched years ago. Some of the older posts on the website do not follow the current format of the site, therefore some of the fields might be missing.     * Snopes.com used to use a service named ""[DoNotLink.com](https://twitter.com/donotlink?lang=en)"" for citation purposes. That service is no longer active and as a result some of the links are missing from older posts on Snopes.      * In addition, some of the shortened links would time-out prior to resolution, in which case they would not be added to the dataset.      * Occasionally, a website that has been cited has not maliciously started a rumor. For instance, Andy Borowitz is a humorist who writes for *The New Yorker*. His satirical column is sometimes mistaken for real news; as a result, *The New Yorker* may be cited as a source of fake news on [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/trump-blasts-media-for-reporting-things-he-says/). This does not mean that *The New Yorker* is a fake news website.     When using the Politifact dataset, please keep the following in mind:     * The data included in this dataset are collected from the ""[truth-o-meter](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/)"" page of Politifact.com.     * Politifact often fact-checks statements made by politicians. Since this dataset is focused on websites, I have ignored all the posts in which the rumor was attributed to a person, a political party, a campaign, or an organization. Instead, I have only included rumors attributed explicitly to websites or blogs.      ---      Useful Tips for Using the Snopes collection     As opposed to the Emergent collection where each page is flagged with whether it was for or against a rumor, no such information is available for the Snopes dataset. To avoid manually labeling the data, you may use the following heuristics to identify which page started a rumor:     * Webpages that are cited in the ""Examples"" section of a post are often ""observing"" the rumor, i.e. they have not started it, but they are repeating it. In the snopes.csv file, these webpages have been flagged as ""page_is_example.""     * Webpages that are cited in the ""Featured Image"" section of a post are often not related to the rumor. The editors on Snopes have simply extracted an image from those pages to embed in their posts. In the snopes.csv file, these webpages have been flagged as ""page_is_image_credit.""     * Webpages that are cited through a secondary service (such as [archive.is](http://archive.is/)) are likelier to be rumor-propagators. Editors do not link to them directly so that a record of their page is available, even if it is later deleted.     * If neither of these hints help, very often (but not always) the first link cited on the page (for which ""page_is_example"" and ""page_is_image_credit"" are false) is the link to a page that started the rumor. This link is identified by the ""page_is_first_citation"" field. Pages for which both ""page_is_first_citation"" and ""page_is_archived"" are true are very likely to be rumor propagators.      * To identify satirical websites that are mistaken for real news, it\'s useful to inspect the way they are cited on Snopes. To demonstrate that a website contains satire or humor, Snopes writers often cite the ""about us"" page of the site. Therefore it\'s useful to  see which domains often contain a URI to their ""about"" page (e.g. ""http://politicops.com/about-us/"").

Acknowledgements    I have published the data for absolutely free using by any site visitor. But this database contains the names of famous brands, so it can not be used for commercial purposes.      Usage    Classification, image recognition and colorizing, etc. in a case of a small number of images are useful exercises.    The main question we can try to answer with the help of the data is whether the algorithms can recognize the unique design style well enough. To facilitate the task, I chose the most easily recognizable brands with a bright style.

The use of CNN leads to significant improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms. Our proposed CNN is giving an average 5.1% misclassification error on testing data.      Context     The motivation of this study is to use cross knowledge learned from multiple works to enhancement the performance of Arabic handwritten character recognition. In recent years, Arabic handwritten characters recognition with different handwriting styles as well, making it important to find and work on a new and advanced solution for handwriting recognition. A deep learning systems needs a huge number of data (images) to be able to make a good decisions.      Content     The data-set is composed of **16,800** characters written by 60 participants, the age range is between 19 to 40 years, and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ’alef’ to ’yeh’) ten times on two forms as shown in Fig. 7(a) &amp; 7(b). The forms were scanned at the resolution of 300 dpi. Each block is segmented automatically using Matlab 2016a to determining the coordinates for each block. The database is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440 characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class). Writers of training set and test set are exclusive. Ordering of including writers to test set are randomized to make sure that writers of test set are not from a single institution (to ensure variability of the test set).     In an experimental section we showed that the results were promising with **94.9%** classification accuracy rate on testing images. In future work, we plan to work on improving the performance of handwritten Arabic character recognition.

Inspiration     Creating the proposed database presents more challenges because it deals with many issues such as style of writing, thickness, dots number and position. Some characters have different shapes while written in the same position. For example the teh character has different shapes in isolated position.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/157,Malicious and Benign Websites," In process to edition ..     Context    Malicious websites are of great concern due it is a problem to analyze one by one and to index each URL in a black list. Unfortunately, there is a lack of datasets with malicious and benign web characteristics. This dataset is a research production of my bachelor students whose aims to fill this gap.      *This is our first dataset version got from our web security project, we are working to improve its results*     Content     The project consisted to evaluate different classification models to predict malicious and benign websites, based on application layer and network characteristics. The data were obtained by using different verified sources of benign and malicious URL's, in a low interactive client honeypot to isolate network traffic. We used additional tools to get other information, such as, server country with Whois.     This is the first version and we have some initial results from applying machine learning classifiers in a bachelor thesis. Further details on the data process making and the data description can be found in the article below.     URL Dataset     This is an important topic and one of the most difficult thing to process, according to other articles and another open resource, we used three black list:    + machinelearning.inginf.units.it/data-andtools/hidden-fraudulent-urls-dataset    + malwaredomainlist.com    + zeuztacker.abuse.ch     From them we got around 185181 URLs, we supposed that they were malicious according to their information, we recommend in a next research step to verity them though another security tool, such as, VirusTotal.     We got the benign URLs (345000) from https://github.com/faizann24/Using-machinelearning-to-detect-malicious-URLs.git, similar to the previous step, a verification process is also recommended through other security systems.      Framework     First we made different scripts in Python in order to systematically analyze and generate the information of each URL (**During the next months we will liberate them to the open source community on GitHub**).     First we verified that each URL was available through the libraries in Python (such as request), we started with around 530181 samples, but as a results of this step the samples were filtered and we got 63191 URLs.     ![Framework to detect malicious websites][1]      Feature generator:     During the research process we found that one way to study a malicious website was the analysis of features from its application layer and network layer, in order to get them, the idea is to apply the dynamic and static analysis.      In the dynamic analysis some articles used web application honeypots kind high interaction, but these resources have not been updated in the last months, so maybe some important vulnerabilities were not mapped.

Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.      Content    Due to size constraints, only the 25 dimension version is uploaded. Please visit the project page for GloVe of other dimensions.     This dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/glove-global-vectors-for-word-representation) contains GloVe extracted from Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5.     1.   Nearest neighbors    The Euclidean distance (or cosine similarity) between two word vectors provides an effective method for measuring the linguistic or semantic similarity of the corresponding words. Sometimes, the nearest neighbors according to this metric reveal rare but relevant words that lie outside an average human's vocabulary.    2.   Linear substructures    The similarity metrics used for nearest neighbor evaluations produce a single scalar that quantifies the relatedness of two words. This simplicity can be problematic since two given words almost always exhibit more intricate relationships than can be captured by a single number. For example, man may be regarded as similar to woman in that both words describe human beings; on the other hand, the two words are often considered opposites since they highlight a primary axis along which humans differ from one another.     In order to capture in a quantitative way the nuance necessary to distinguish man from woman, it is necessary for a model to associate more than a single number to the word pair. A natural and simple candidate for an enlarged set of discriminative numbers is the vector difference between the two word vectors. GloVe is designed in order that such vector differences capture as much as possible the meaning specified by the juxtaposition of two words.

Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.     The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. ""If it doesn\'t work on MNIST, it won\'t work at all"", they said. ""Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.""     Zalando seeks to replace the original MNIST dataset     Content     Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/179,Thermal soccer dataset," Context     Simultaneous tracking of multiple people is still a very challenging computer vision problem. This is especially true for sports activities, for which people often wear similar uniforms, move quickly and erratically, and have close interactions with each other.     This dataset is captured with thermal cameras, which enables easier segmentation and ensures privacy of people in public facilities, but at the same time we are left with no distinct appearance information to guide our tracking algorithms.        Content     This dataset contains four 30-seconds video sequences of eight people playing soccer in an indoor arena (court size 40*20 metres). The video is captured by thermal cameras of type AXIS Q1922 with a resolution of 640*480 pixels and 25 fps. The three images are stitched to one image of 1920*480 pixels.    The videos are manually annotated for tracking.       Acknowledgements     Gade, R. &amp; Moeslund, T.B.: Constrained multi-target tracking for team sports activities.

It includes data from    the two current leagues (American and National), the four other ""major""     leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and    Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.      This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to    make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What    started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a    team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the    largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available    anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key    contributors to this project.)     None of what we have done would have been possible without the    pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete    Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude    to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set    of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of    the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over    the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts.    Please vist their website (www.sabr.org).     This database can never take the place of a good reference book like     The Baseball Encyclopedia.  But it will enable people do to the kind     of queries and analysis that those traditional sources don\'t allow.     If you have any problems or find any errors, please let us know.  Any     feedback is appreciated     ----------------------------------------------------------------------    1.2 What\'s New in 2012      There has been significant cleanup in the master file     MLB\'s addition of wildcard games in 2012 adds two new types of records    to the post-season files.  The abbreviations ALWC and NLWC are used to    denote each league\'s wild card game.     Added the MLB ""Comeback Player of the Year"" award to the awards table     Florida Marlins changed their name to the Miami Marlins, new team abbr is MIA     ----------------------------------------------------------------------    1.3 Acknowledgements     Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of    Pete Palmer, the legendary statistician, who has had a hand in most     of the baseball encylopedias published since 1974. He is largely     responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out    of the dark ages and into the computer era.  Without him, none of this    would be possible.  For more on Pete\'s work, please read his own     account at: http://sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf     Two people have been key contributors to the work that followed, first     by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later     by extending the database to make it more accesible to researchers.     Sean Lahman launched the Baseball Archive\'s website back before     most people had heard of the world wide web.  Frustrated by the    lack of sports data available, he led the effort to build a     baseball database that everyone could use. Baseball researchers     everywhere owe him a debt of gratitude.  Lahman served as an associate    editor for three editions of Total Baseball and contributed to five    editions of The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia. He has also been active in    developing databases for other sports.     The work of Sean Forman to create and maintain an online encyclopedia    at ""baseball-reference.com"" has been remarkable. Recognized as the     premier online reference source, Forman\'s site provides an oustanding    interface to the raw data. His efforts to help streamline the database    have been extremely helpful. Most importantly, Forman has spearheaded    the effort to provide standards that enable several different baseball    databases to be used together. He was also instrumental in launching    the Baseball Databank, a forum for researchers to gather and share    their work.     Since 2001, these two Seans have led a group of researchers    who volunteered to maintain and update the database.      A handful of researchers have made substantial contributions to     maintain this database in recent years. Listed alphabetically, they     are: Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Rod Nelson, Tom Tango,    and Paul Wendt. These folks did much of the heavy lifting, and are     largely responsible for the improvements made in the last decade.     Others who made important contributions include: Dvd Avins,     Clifford Blau, Bill Burgess, Clem Comly, Jeff Burk, Randy Cox,     Mitch Dickerman, Paul DuBois, Mike Emeigh, F.X. Flinn, Bill Hickman,    Jerry Hoffman, Dan Holmes, Micke Hovmoller, Peter Kreutzer,     Danile Levine, Bruce Macleod, Ken Matinale, Michael Mavrogiannis,    Cliff Otto, Alberto Perdomo, Dave Quinn, John Rickert, Tom Ruane,    Theron Skyles, Hans Van Slootenm, Michael Westbay, and Rob Wood.     Many other people have made significant contributions to the database    over the years.  The contribution of Tom Ruane\'s effort to the overall    quality of the underlying data has been tremendous. His work at    retrosheet.org integrates the yearly data with the day-by-day data,    creating a reference source of startling depth. It is unlikely than     any individual has contributed as much to the field of baseball     research in the past five years as Ruane has.     Sean Holtz helped with a major overhaul and redesign before the    2000 season. Keith Woolner was instrumental in helping turn    a huge collection of stats into a relational database in the mid-1990s.    Clifford Otto &amp; Ted Nye also helped provide guidance to the early     versions. Lee Sinnis, John Northey &amp; Erik Greenwood helped supply key    pieces of data. Many others have written in with corrections and     suggestions that made each subsequent version even better than what    preceded it.      The work of the SABR Baseball Records Committee, led by Lyle Spatz    has been invaluable.  So has the work of Bill Carle and the SABR     Biographical Committee. David Vincent, keeper of the Home Run Log and    other bits of hard to find info, has always been helpful. The recent    addition of colleges to player bios is the result of much research by    members of SABR\'s Collegiate Baseball committee.     Salary data has been supplied by Doug Pappas, who passed away during    the summer of 2004. He was the leading authority on many subjects,     most significantly the financial history of Major League Baseball.     We are grateful that he allowed us to include some of the data he     compiled.  His work has been continued by the SABR Business of     Baseball committee.       Thanks is also due to the staff at the National Baseball Library    in Cooperstown who have been so helpful -- Tim Wiles, Jim Gates,    Bruce Markusen, and the rest of the staff.       A special debt of gratitude is owed to Dave Smith and the folks at    Retrosheet. There is no other group working so hard to compile and    share baseball data.  Their website (www.retrosheet.org) will give    you a taste of the wealth of information Dave and the gang have collected.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/186,"DueCredit: automated collection of citations for software, methods, and data","Data analysis software and canonical datasets are the driving force behind many fields of empirical sciences. Despite being of paramount importance, those resources are most often not adequately cited. Although some can consider this a “social” problem, its roots are technical: Users of those resources often are simply not aware of the underlying computational libraries and methods they have been using in their research projects. This in-turn fosters inefficient practices that encourage the development of new projects, instead of contributing to existing established ones. Some projects (e.g. FSL) facilitate citation of the utilized methods, but such efforts are not uniform, and the output is rarely in commonly used citation formats (e.g. BibTeX). DueCredit is a simple framework to embed information about publications or other references within the original code or dataset descriptors. References are automatically reported to the user whenever a given functionality or dataset is being used.DueCredit is currently available for Python, but we envision extending support to other frameworks (e.g., Matlab, R). Until DueCredit gets adopted natively by the projects, it provides the functionality to “inject” references for 3rd party modules.For the developer, DueCredit implements a decorator @due.dcite that allows to link a method or class to a set of references that can be specified through a doi or BibTeX entry. The initial release of DueCredit (0.1.0) was implemented during the OHBM 2015 hackathon and uploaded to pypi and is freely available. DueCredit provides a concise API to associate a publication reference with any given module or function. DueCredit comes with a simple demo code, which demonstrates its utility. DueCredit is in its early stages of development, but two days of team development at the OHBM hackathon were sufficient to establish a usable prototype implementation. Since then, the code-base was further improved and multiple beta-releases followed, expanding the coverage of citable resources (e.g., within scipy, sklearn modules via injections and PyMVPA natively)."," Neuroscience, Imaging"

Project website: https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~jmuelmen/projects/ and https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~jmuelmen/projects/precerf.html    This research was funded by the European Union under ERC Starting Grant    QUAERERE, grant agreement 306284, and by the United States National Science    Foundation under grant agreements AGS-1013423 and AGS-1048995.    Summary: Attenuated backscatter profiles from the CALIOP satellite lidar are used to estimate cloud base heights of lower-troposphere liquid clouds (cloud base height below approximately 3 km).  Even when clouds are thick enough to attenuate the lidar beam (optical thickness &gt; 5), the technique provides cloud base heights by treating the cloud base height of nearby thinner clouds as representative of the surrounding cloud field.  Using ground-based ceilometer data, uncertainty estimates for the cloud base height product at retrieval resolution are derived as a function of various properties of the CALIOP lidar profiles.  Evaluation of the predicted cloud base heights and their predicted uncertainty using a second, statistically independent, ceilometer dataset shows that cloud base heights and uncertainties are biased by less than 10%.    CBASE provides two files for each CALIOP VFM input file: one using a 40 km window to detect the cloud field base height, and one using a 100 km window. (The input CALIOP VFM dataset is organized by the daytime/nighttime half of each orbit.) The file name pattern is    CBASE_T.nc (identical to the input    CALIOP VFM file name with the exception of the product name). Files are organized into subdirectories by half-orbit start date.","Climate,  Cloudbase,  cloud base"
https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/194,LORIS: DICOM anonymizer,"The purpose of this Brainhack project was to create a simple application, with the least dependencies, for anonymization of DICOM files directly on a workstation. Anonymization of DICOM datasets is a requirement before an imaging study can be uploaded in a web-based database system, such as LORIS. Currently, a simple and efficient interface for the anonymization of such imaging datasets, which works on all operating systems and is very light in terms of dependencies, is not available. Here, we created a DICOM anonymizer that is a simple graphical tool that uses PyDICOM package to anonymize DICOM datasets easily on any operating system, with no dependencies except for the default Python and NumPy packages. DICOM anonymizer is available for all UNIX systems (including Mac OS) and can be easily installed on Windows computers as well (see PyDICOM installation). The GUI (using tkinter) and the processing pipeline were designed in Python. Executing the anonymizer_gui.py script with a python compiler will start the program. Figure 1 illustrates how to use the program to anonymize a DICOM study. The DICOM anonymizer is a simple standalone graphical tool that facilitates anonymization of DICOM datasets on any operating system. These anonymized studies can be uploaded to a web-based database system, such as LORIS, without compromising the patient or participant’s identity.","Neuroscience,  Data_MISCELLANEOUS,  Imaging"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/200,WOCE-Argo Global Hydrographic Climatology (WAGHC Version 1.0),"Project: WOCE-Argo Global Hydrographic Climatology - The WAGHC is a full-depth one-fourth degree resolution temperature and salinity climatology describing the mean state of the World Ocean between 1996 and 2011, with monthly gridded fields available between the surface and 1778 m depth.    World Ocean Database 2013 (Locarnini et al., 2013) provided the majority of the temperature and salinity profiles, whereas data from the Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Bremerhaven, and from several Canadian Institutes helped to improve the data basis for the North Polar region considerably. A rigorous data quality control procedure was applied to the original profiles to exclude erroneous and highly untypical data.    The spatial interpolation of the quality-controlled data was performed both on isobaric and isopycnal levels, so that essentially two climatologies are available. The isopycnally-averaged climatology mimics the process of isopycnal mixing in the real ocean and therefore is less prone to the production of artificial water masses.    The WAGHC climatology represents the update of the WOCE Global Hydrographic Climatology (Gouretski and Koltermann, 2004). The name of the new climatology was chosen to highlight both the outstanding role of the WOCE hydrographic data for the historical global hydrographic archive and the importance of the more recent data from the Argo floats.

Funder:    The work was conducted as part of the Excellence Initiative CLISAP at the Universität Hamburg, funded through the German Science Foundation (Grant EXC 177/2)    Summary: The WOCE/ARGO Global Hydrographic Climatology (WAGHC) is concieved as the update of the previous WOCE Global Hydrographic Climatology (WGHC) (Gouretski and Koltermann, 2004).    The following improvements have been made compared to the WGHC:    2) finer spatial resolution (0.25 degrees Lat/Lon compared to 0.5 degrees for WGHC);    3) finer vertical resolution (65 compared to 45 WGHC standard levels);    4) monthly temporal resolution compared to the all-data-mean WGHC parameters;    5) narrower overall time period;    6) calculation of the mean year corresponding to the optimally interpolated temperature and salinity values;    7) depth of the upper mixed layer.     Similar to the WGHC the optimal spatial interpolation is performed on the local isopycnal surfaces. This approach diminishes the production of the artificial water masses. In addition to the isopycnally interpolated parameters parameter values interpolated on the isobaric levels are also provided.    The monthly gridded vertical profiles extend to the depth of 1898 m, below only annual mean parameter values are available.    Additionally, there is a dataset and a map available providing indexes for selected regions of the world ocean.    Finally, the comparison with the last update of the NOAA World Ocean Atlas (Locarnini et al, 2013) was done.","Climate,  WAGHC,  observational data,  ocean"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/203,Supraglacial Debris Cover,"This dataset is supplementary to the article of Scherler et al. (submitted), in which the global distribution of supraglacial debris cover is mapped and analyzed. For mapping supraglacial debris cover, we combined glacier outlines from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) version 6.0 (RGI consortium, 2017) with remote sensing-based ice and snow identification. Areas that belong to glaciers but that are neither ice nor snow were classified as debris cover. This dataset contains the outlines of the mapped debris-covered glaciers areas, stored in shapefiles (.shp). For creating this dataset, we used optical satellite data from Landsat 8 (for the time period 2013-2017), and from Sentinel-2A/B (2015-2017). For the ice and snow identification, we used three different algorithms: a red to short-wavelength infrared (swir) band ratio (RATIO; Hall et al., 1988), the normalized difference snow index (NDSI; Dozier, 1989), and linear spectral unmixing-derived fractional debris cover (FDC; e.g., Keshava and Mustard, 2002). For a detailed description of the debris-cover mapping and an analysis of the data, please see Scherler et al. (2019) to which these data are supplementary material. This dataset includes debris cover outlines based on either Landsat 8 (LS8; 30-m resolution) or Sentinel 2 (S2; 10-m resolution), and the three algorithms RATIO, NDSI, FDC. In total, there exist six different zip-files that each contain 19 shapefiles. The structure of the shapefiles follows that of the RGI version 6.0 (RGI consortium, 2017), with one shapefile for each RGI region. The original RGI shapefiles provide each glacier as one entry (feature) and include a variety of ancillary information, such as area, slope, aspect (RGI Consortium 2017a, Technical Note p. 12ff). Because the debris-cover outlines are based on the RGI v6.0 glacier outlines, all fields of the original shapefiles, which refer to the glacier, are retained, and expanded with four new fields: - DC_Area: Debris-covered area in m². Note that this unit for area is different from the unit used for reporting the glacier area (km²).- DC_BgnDate: Start of the time period from which satellite imagery was used to map debris cover.- DC_EndDate: End of the time period from which satellite imagery was used to map debris cover.- DC_CTSmean: Mean number of observations (CTS = COUNTS) per pixel and glacier. This number is derived from the number of available satellite images for the respective time period, reduced by filtering pixels due to cloud and snow cover. The dataset has a global extent and covers all of the glaciers in the RGI v. 6.0, but it exhibits poor coverage in the RGI region Subantarctic and Antarctic, where the debris cover extents are based on very few observations.","Earth Observation Satellites &gt; LANDSAT &gt; LANDSAT-8,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; CRYOSPHERE &gt; GLACIERS/ICE SHEETS &gt; GLACIERS,  Landsat 8,  Debris-covered glaciers,  Remote sensing,  EARTH SCIENCE SERVICES &gt; MODELS &gt; CRYOSPHERE MODELS,  Earth Observation Satellites &gt; Sentinel GMES &gt; SENTINEL-2,  Sentinel-2A/B"

Effects of agricultural soil management can be assessed by soil, crop, and ecosystem models but global assessments are hampered by lack of information on type and spatial distribution. This dataset is the result of a study on global classification of tillage practices and the spatially explicit mapping of crop-specific tillage systems for around the year 2005.          This global gridded tillage system data set is dedicated to modeling communities interested in the quantitative assessment of biophysical and biogeochemical impacts of land use and soil management on cropland. The data set is complemented by the publication of the R- code and can be used for reproducing and build upon for scenarios including the expansion of sustainable soil management practices as Conservation Agriculture (Porwollik et al. 2018, http://doi.org/10.5880/PIK.2018.013).

""r2"" means that the fruit was rotated around the 3rd axis. ""100"" comes from image size (100x100 pixels).     Different varieties of the same fruit (apple for instance) are stored as belonging to different classes.      How we made it     Fruits were planted in the shaft of a low speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded.      A Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available.     Behind the fruits we placed a white sheet of paper as background.      However due to the variations in the lighting conditions, the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm which extract the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type:  we start from each edge of the image and we mark all pixels there, then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step until no more pixels can be marked.     All marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of pixels are considered as belonging to the object.     The maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie.

Earth System Science Data Discussions, 1-16","Snow depths and bulk densities of the annual snow layer were measured at 69 different locations on glaciers across Nordenskiöldland, Svalbard, during the spring seasons of the period 2014–2016. Sampling locations lie along nine transects extending over 17 individual glaciers. Several of the locations were visited repeatedly, leading to a total of 109 point measurements, on which we report in this study. Snow water equivalents were calculated for each point measurement. In the dataset, snow depth and density measurements are accompanied by appropriate uncertainties which are rigorously transferred to the calculated snow water equivalents using a straightforward Monte Carlo simulation-style procedure. The final dataset can be downloaded from the Pangaea data repository (https://www.pangaea.de; https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.896581). Snow cover data indicate a general and statistically significant increase of snow depths and water equivalents with terrain elevation. A significant increase of both quantities with decreasing distance towards the east coast of Nordenskiöldland is also evident, but shows distinct interannual variability. Snow density does not show any characteristic spatial pattern."," DATE/TIME, Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0,  glacier ID,  Flag,  Elevation of event,  Snow density,  uncertainty,  Longitude of event,  Event label,  Number,  Snow water equivalent,  DEPTH,  ice/snow,  Latitude of event,  Density,  snow,  Snow depth"

The thesis presents research undertaken to develop a model for the combined steady state simulation and operation planning of integrated energy supply systems. As part of the thesis, three key components of the model were developed i.e: 1)    Optimal power dispatch of an integrated energy system: A real case study was used to demonstrate the economic benefits of considering the interactions between different energy systems in their design and operation planning. This work is presented in Chapter 3 of the PhD thesis. The data related to this work is available in the XLS file titled 'Chapter 3_Optimal power dispatch_Dataset’. These data provide, for the period 1/4/2014 - 31/3/2015, half-hourly figures for electricity demand (kW) and from two centres, the heat demand (kW), and optimal gas input to gas boiler (kW), optimal gas input to CHP unit (kW), optimal electricity input (kW), optimal electric chiller electricity input (kW), optimal heat input to absorption chiller (kW), marginal cost of electricity (£), marginal cost of heat (£), marginal cost of cooling (£) in terms of electricity demand (kW) and heat demand (kW) in 500kW bins.  2)    Simultaneous steady state analysis of coupled energy networks: An example of a coupled electricity, gas, district heating and district cooling network system was used to illustrate the formulation of equations and the iterative solution method. A case study was carried out to demonstrate the application of the method for integrated energy network analysis. This work is presented in Chapter 5 of the PhD thesis. The data related to this work is available in the XLS file titled ‘Chapter 5_case study_Data set’. The data provide, for 3 cases: electricity network results - for bus bar, energy demands (MW), power generation (MW) and voltage magnitude and voltage angle, and branch results comprising active power and re-active power to and from bus injection, and real and reactive power losses; gas network information - for gas node, gas demand, CHP gas demand, boiler gas demand, total gas supply and gas pressure, and pipe data for gas flow rate and pressure drop; heat network information - for hear node, fixed heat demand, absorption chiller heat demand, total heat demand, heat supply, mass flow into node, supply-line and return-line temperatures, supply-line and return-line pressures, and pubmping power, and branch information of mass flow rate, supply-line and return-line heat loss, line heat loss, supply-line and return-line temperature loss, line heat loss, supply-line and return-line termperature drop,  branch pressure drop and branch specific pressure drop; cooling network information - for cooling node, fixed cooling demand, cooling supply, mass flow into node, supply-line and return-line temperature, supply-line and return-line pressure, pumping power, and for branch, mass flow rate, supply-line heat gain, return-lin heat loss and branch pressure drop.  3)    Steady state analysis of gas networks with the distributed injection of alternative gases: A case study was carried out to demonstrate the impact of alternative gas injections on the pressure delivery and gas quality in the network. This work is presented in Chapter 6 of the PhD thesis. The data related to this work is available in the XLS file titled ‘Chapter 5_case study_Data set’. Data provides: node pressure (mbar) and branch flow-rate(m^3/hr); pressure (mbar) for the nodes under hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixture and for upgraded biogas mixture; for the nodes the actual energy demand (kJ/s) and available energy; pressure (mbar) and wobbe index at nodes for two methodes and flow rate in branches, for the two methods, over various periods.","Process Design,  Conventional Power Plants"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/244,Twitter Threads," Context     When Twitter introduced its thread functionality, a debate emerged: ""If you\'re gonna write a f*ck ton of tweets at once, why not write a blog post instead of cluttering my feed?""... ""It\'s easier and user-friendlier to share ideas in a single app""...          I\'m not getting into that debate. Both blog posts and Twitter threads have their own advantages.              But I noticed a phenomenon while reading threads on Twitter: **the engagement—*retweets, likes and replies*—drops with each subsequent tweet!**     Now, this has some logical explanations. Like, people don\'t want to retweet or like *every* tweet in a thread, because that\'d be annoying. But this trend kept appearing in every single thread I read.            It was bugging me, so I had to gather some data.      Content    The dataset is divided into **five** parts:       - `five_ten.csv`: data of threads 5-10 tweets long       - `ten_fifteen.csv`: data of threads 10-15 tweets long       - `fifteen_twenty.csv`: data of threads 15-20 tweets long       - `twenty_twentyfive.csv`: data of threads 20-25 tweets long       - `twentyfive_thirty.csv`: data of threads 25-30 tweets long                  They all contain the same data:       - `id`: Tweet ID (maybe I should remove it to anonymize the data?)       - `thread_number`: Thread identifier, used for grouping each thread and its tweets       - `timestamp`: Creation date of each tweet     - `text`: The content of each tweet       - `retweets`: Retweet count for each tweet       - `likes`: Like count for each tweet       - `replies`: Reply count for each tweet                  Each ""bin"" contains around 100 threads... so in total there are ~500 threads.      Acknowledgements     The threads were manually gathered using [Thread Reader][1] (both the web page and the [bot][2]).        Disclaimer    The content of the threads/tweets **did not** had any influence in choosing a thread or not. The only parameter was the length of the thread (5-30 tweets tops). The tweets collected date from October 2017 to May 2018.      Inspiration          Some things I noticed while gathering the data was that political threads have a steadier engagement than, say, art threads. So **context might influence thread engagement**, and it\'d be interesting to do some NLP to figure that out.            Also it\'d be cool to find a ""formula"" for better engagement in Twitter threads, like how long should a thread be? or maybe a probability of engagement based on the success of the initial tweet?            Finally, this whole issue reminds me of [the headline problem][3]: most people don\'t go beyond the headline. Maybe Twitter threads suffer from that too.

Boundary conditions of pentad sea surface temperature and monthly sea ice concentration and time-varying solar, volcanic, and carbon dioxide radiative forcings are prescribed. Products include 3 and 6-hourly ensemble mean and spread analysis fields and 6-hourly ensemble mean and spread forecast (first guess) fields on a global Gaussian T254 grid. Fields are accessible in yearly time series (1 file per parameter). The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Version 3 uses the NCEP Global Forecast Model that was operational in autumn 2017, with differences as described in (Slivinski et al. 2019). Sea ice boundary conditions are specified from HadISST 2.3 (Slivinski et al. 2019). Sea surface temperature fields prior to 1981 are prescribed from the 8-member ensemble of pentad Simple Ocean Data Assimilation with sparse input (SODAsi.3, Giese et al. 2016) and from the 8-member ensemble of pentad HadISST 2.2 for 1981 to 2015.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/268,A cortical surface-based geodesic distance package for Python,"The human cerebral cortex, whether tracing it through phylogeny or ontogeny, emerges through expansion and progressive differentiation into larger and more diverse areas. While current methodologies address this analytically by characterizing local cortical expansion in the form of surface area, several lines of research have proposed that the cortex in fact expands along trajectories from primordial anchor areas and furthermore, that the distance along the cortical surface is informative regarding cortical differentiation . We sought to investigate the geometric relationships that arise in the cortex based on expansion from such origin points. Towards this aim, we developed a Python package for measuring the geodesic distance along the cortical surface that restricts shortest paths from passing through nodes of non-cortical areas such as the non-cortical portions of the surface mesh described as the “medial wall’.The calculation of geodesic distance along a mesh surface is based in the cumulative distance of the shortest path between two points. The first challenge that arises is the sensitivity of the calculation to the resolution of the mesh: the coarser the mesh, the longer the shortest path may be, as the distance becomes progressively less direct. This problem has been previously addressed and subsequently implemented in the Python package gdist, which calculates the exact geodesic distance along a mesh by subdividing the shortest path until a straight line along the cortex is approximated. The second challenge, for which there was no prefabricated solution, was ensuring that the shortest path only traverses territory within the cortex proper, avoiding shortcuts through non-cortical areas included in the surface mesh — most prominently, the non-cortical portions along the medial wall. Were the shortest paths between two nodes to traverse non-cortical regions, the distance between nodes would be artificially decreased, which would have artifactual impact on the interpretation of results. This concern would be especially relevant to the ‘zones analysis’ described below, where the boundaries between regions would be altered. It was therefore necessary to remove mesh nodes prior to calculating the exact geodesic distance, which requires reconstructing the mesh and assigning the respective new node indices for any seed regions-of-interest.Finally, to facilitate applications to neuroscience research questions, we enabled the loading and visualization of data from commonly used formats such as FreeSurfer and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). A Nipype pipeline for group-level batch processing has also been made available . The pipeline is wrapped in a command-line interface and allows for straightforward distance calculations of entire FreeSurfer-preprocessed datasets. Group-level data are stored as CSV files for each requested mesh resolution, source label and hemisphere, facilitating further statistical analyses.The resultant package, SurfDist, achieves the aforementioned goals of faciliating the calculation of exact geodesic distance on the cortical surface. We present here the distance measures from the central and calcarine sulci labels on the FreeSurfer native surfaces. The distance measure provides a means to parcellate the cortex using the surface geometry. Towards that aim, we also implement a ‘zones analysis’, which constructs a Voronoi diagram, establishing partitions based on the greater proximity to a set of label nodes.The SurfDist package is designed to enable investigation of intrinisic geometric properties of the cerebral cortex based on geodesic distance measures. Towards the aim of enabling applications specific to neuroimaging-based research question, we have designed the package to facilitate analysis and visualization of geodesic distance metrics using standard cortical surface meshes."," Neuroscience, Imaging"

The data are characterized by daily sampling between 18.5.1995 and 3.4.2012 including data gaps and a consistent spatial resolution up to 1 km. More details can be found in the related User Manual. The dataset is based on Dynamic Ocean Topography (DOT) elevations from a combination of along-track satellite altimetry measurements with simulated differential water heights from the Finite Element Sea-ice Ocean Model Version 1.4 (FESOM, Wekerle et al., 2017, doi:10.1002/2017JC012974). The combination approach is described in detail in the related publication. The altimetry data include observations of the ESA satellites Envisat and ERS-2. The high-frequent altimetry range observations are retracked using the ALES+ algorithm (Passaro et al., 2018, doi:10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.074) and are classified into open-water/sea-ice conditions by applying a classification algorithm (Müller et al., 2017, doi:10.3390/rs9060551). All applied atmospheric and geophysical altimetry corrections are listed in Müller et al., 2019 (doi:10.5194/tc-13-611-2019)."," File format,  File name,  File size,  Uniform resource locator/link to file, Arctic Ocean,  Dynamic Ocean Topography,  Geostrophic Currents,  Ocean Modeling,  Principal Component Analysis,  Satellite altimetry,  Variations in ocean currents,  sea ice concentration,  and sea surface temperature along the North-East coast of Greenland (NEG-OCEAN)"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/287,Solar and Lunar Eclipses," Context      Eclipses of the sun can only occur when the moon is near one of its two orbital nodes during the new moon phase. It is then possible for the Moon's penumbral, umbral, or antumbral shadows to sweep across Earth's surface thereby producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses: a partial eclipse, during which the moon's penumbral shadow traverses Earth and umbral and antumbral shadows completely miss Earth; an annular eclipse, during which the moon's antumbral shadow traverses Earth but does not completely cover the sun; a total eclipse, during which the moon's umbral shadow traverses Earth and completely covers the sun; and a hybrid eclipse, during which the moon's umbral and antumbral shadows traverse Earth and annular and total eclipses are visible in different locations. Earth will experience 11898 solar eclipses during the five millennium period -1999 to +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE).     Eclipses of the moon can occur when the moon is near one of its two orbital nodes during the full moon phase. It is then possible for the moon to pass through Earth's penumbral or umbral shadows thereby producing an eclipse. There are three types of lunar eclipses: a penumbral eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral shadow but misses its umbral shadow; a partial eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral and umbral shadows; and a total eclipse, during which the moon traverses Earth's penumbral and umbral shadows and passes completely into Earth's umbra.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/289,Study 3 data,"Dataset connected with article: 'Increasing the use of conceptually-derived strategies in arithmetic: using inversion problems to promote the use of associativity shortcuts.' Abstract: Conceptual knowledge of key principles underlying arithmetic is an important precursor to understanding algebra and later success in mathematics. One such principle is associativity, which allows individuals to solve problems in different ways by decomposing and recombining subexpressions (e.g. ‘a + b – c’ = ‘b – c + a’). More than any other principle, children and adults alike have difficulty understanding it, and educators have called for this to change. We report three intervention studies that were conducted in university classrooms to investigate whether adults’ use of associativity could be improved. In all three studies, it was found that those who first solved inversion problems (e.g. ‘a + b – b’) were more likely than controls to then use associativity on ‘a + b – c’ problems. We suggest that ‘a + b – b’ inversion problems may either direct spatial attention to the location of ‘b – c’ on associativity problems, or implicitly communicate the validity and efficiency of a right-to-left strategy. These findings may be helpful for those designing brief activities that aim to aid the understanding of arithmetic principles and algebra.",170299 Cognitive Science not elsewhere classified

Cloud-free Landsat images are obtained immediately after snowmelt season (e.g. between May, 15 and June, 18), to detect the highest possible number of aufeis. Critical values of Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) were used for semi-automated aufeis detection. However, a detailed expert-based verification was performed after automated procedure, to distinguish snow-covered areas from aufeis and cross-reference historical and satellite-based data collections. According to Landsat data, the number of aufeis reaches 1213, with their total area about 1287 km².

Typical sources of low back pain include:     - The large nerve roots in the low back that go to the legs may be irritated    - The smaller nerves that supply the low back may be irritated    - The large paired lower back muscles (erector spinae) may be strained    - The bones, ligaments or joints may be damaged    - An intervertebral disc may be degenerating     An irritation or problem with any of these structures can cause lower back pain and/or pain that radiates or is referred to other parts of the body. Many lower back problems also cause back muscle spasms, which don't sound like much but can cause severe pain and disability.     While lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.     This data set is about to identify a person is abnormal or normal using collected physical spine details/data.","small,  featured,  human activities,  health care economics and organizations,  natural and physical sciences &gt; biology &gt; health sciences &gt; public health &gt; healthcare,  equipment and supplies,  health services administration,  population characteristics"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/314,Multi-source global wetland maps combining surface water imagery and groundwater constraints,"Many maps of open water and wetland have been developed based on three main methods: (i) compiling national/regional wetland surveys; (ii) identifying inundated areas by satellite imagery; (iii) delineating wetlands as shallow water table areas based on groundwater modelling. The resulting global wetland extents, however, vary from 3 to 21% of the land surface area, because of inconsistencies in wetland definitions and limitations in observation or modelling systems. To reconcile these differences, we propose composite wetland (CW) maps combining two classes of wetlands: (1) regularly flooded wetlands (RFW) which are obtained by overlapping selected open-water and inundation datasets; (2) groundwater-driven wetlands (GDW) derived from groundwater modelling (either direct or simplified using several variants of the topographic index). Wetlands are thus statically defined as areas with persistent near saturated soil because of regular flooding or shallow groundwater. To explore the uncertainty of the proposed data fusion, seven CW maps were generated at the 15 arc-sec resolution (ca 500 m at the Equator) using geographic information system (GIS) tools, by combining one RFW and different GDW maps. They correspond to contemporary potential wetlands, i.e. the expected wetlands assuming no human influence under the present climate. To validate the approach, these CW maps were compared to existing wetland datasets at the global and regional scales: the spatial patterns are decently captured, but the wetland extents are difficult to assess against the dispersion of the validation datasets. Compared to the only regional dataset encompassing both GDWs and RFWs, over France, the CW maps perform well and better than all other considered global wetland datasets. Two CW maps, showing the best overall match with the available evaluation datasets, are eventually selected. They give a global wetland extent of 27.5 and 29 million km², i.e. 21.1 and 21.6% of global land area, which is among the highest values in the literature, in line with recent estimates also recognizing the contribution of GDWs. This wetland class covers 15% of global land area, against 9.7% for RFWs (with an overlap ca 3.4 %), including wetlands under canopy/cloud cover leading to high wetland densities in the tropics, and small scattered wetlands, which cover less than 5% of land but are very important for hydrological and ecological functioning in temperate to arid areas. By distinguishing the RFWs and GDWs globally based on uniform principles, the proposed dataset is believed to be useful for large-scale land surface modelling (hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical modelling) and environmental planning."," File format,  File size,  Uniform resource locator/link to file, File name"

Seasonal cycle and human impacts on TWS are not reconstructed. A GRACE-based seasonal cycle is provided for convenience and should be used with the awareness that in reality long-term changes in the shape of the seasonal cycle might potentially occur. Long-term signals (trends over a period &gt;15 years) are removed during the model calibration procedure but are still present in the final dataset. The interpretation of the reconstructed long-term trends should be done with particular caution and the awareness that there can be some uncertainty in the reconstructed trends.For most applications, uncertainty ranges can be derived from the 100 ensemble members available for each model.The grids are stored in NetCDFv4 files in units of mm (kg m^-2). Although the data is provided on a 0.5 degrees grid, the effective spatial resolution should be considered to be 3 degrees, similar to the original resolution of the GRACE datasets. This might need to be taken into account when comparing this dataset against other sources.The global means are stored as csv files in units of Gt of water.

Earth System Science Data Discussions.Vincent Humphrey, May 2019California Institute of TechnologyYour feedback is always welcome:vincent.humphrey[-a-t-]caltech.edu (vincent.humphrey[-a-t-]bluewin.ch) Abstract          The    amount of water stored on continents is an important constraint for water mass    and energy exchanges in the Earth system and exhibits large inter-annual    variability at both local and continental scales. From 2002 to 2017, the    satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission (GRACE) have    observed changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) with an unprecedented level    of accuracy. In this paper, we use a statistical model trained with GRACE    observations to reconstruct past climate-driven changes in TWS from historical and    near real time meteorological datasets at daily and monthly scales. Unlike most    hydrological models which represent water reservoirs individually (e.g. snow,    soil moisture, etc.) and usually provide a single model run, the presented    approach directly reconstructs total TWS changes and includes hundreds of    ensemble members which can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty. We    compare these data-driven TWS estimates with other independent evaluation    datasets such as the sea level budget, large-scale water balance from    atmospheric reanalysis and in-situ streamflow measurements. We find that the    presented approach performs overall as well or better than a set of    state-of-the-art global hydrological models (Water Resources Reanalysis version    2). We provide reconstructed TWS anomalies at a spatial resolution of 0.5°, at both    daily and monthly scales over the period 1901 to present, based on two    different GRACE products and three different meteorological forcing datasets,    resulting in 6 reconstructed TWS datasets of 100 ensemble members each. Possible    user groups and applications include hydrological modelling and model    benchmarking, sea level budget studies, assessments of long-term changes in the    frequency of droughts, the analysis of climate signals in geodetic time series    and the interpretation of the data gap between the GRACE and the GRACE    Follow-On mission.Check reference for additional details and caveats.ReferenceHumphrey V. &amp; Gudmundsson L.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/327,BBC News Summary," Context     Text summarization is a way to condense the large amount of information into a concise form by the process of selection of important information and discarding unimportant and redundant information. With the amount of textual information present in the world wide web the area of text summarization is becoming very important. The extractive summarization is the one where the exact sentences present in the document are used as summaries. The extractive summarization is simpler and is the general practice among the automatic text summarization researchers at the present time. Extractive summarization process involves giving scores to sentences using some method and then using the sentences that achieve highest scores as summaries. As the exact sentence present in the document is used the semantic factor can be ignored which results in generation of less calculation intensive summarization procedure. This kind of summary is generally completely unsupervised and language independent too. Although this kind of summary does its job in conveying the essential information it may not be necessarily smooth or fluent. Sometimes there can be almost no connection between adjacent sentences in the summary resulting in the text lacking in readability.        Content     This dataset for extractive text summarization has four hundred and seventeen political news articles of BBC from 2004 to 2005 in the News Articles folder. For each articles, five summaries are provided in the Summaries folder. The first clause of the text of articles is the respective title.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/328,Ships in Satellite Imagery," Context    Satellite imagery provides unique insights into various markets, including agriculture, defense and intelligence, energy, and finance. New commercial imagery providers, such as [Planet](https://www.planet.com/), are using constellations of small satellites to capture images of the entire Earth every day.      This flood of new imagery is outgrowing the ability for organizations to manually look at each image that gets captured, and there is a need for machine learning and computer vision algorithms to help automate the analysis process.      The aim of this dataset is to help address the difficult task of detecting the location of large ships in satellite images. Automating this process can be applied to many issues including monitoring port activity levels and supply chain analysis.          Content    The dataset consists of image chips extracted from Planet satellite imagery collected over the San Francisco Bay and San Pedro Bay areas of California. It includes 4000 80x80 RGB images labeled with either a ""ship"" or ""no-ship"" classification. Image chips were derived from PlanetScope full-frame visual scene products, which are orthorectified to a 3 meter pixel size.      Provided is a zipped directory `shipsnet.zip` that contains the entire dataset as .png image chips. Each individual image filename follows a specific format: {label} __ {scene id} __ {longitude} _ {latitude}.png     - **label:** Valued 1 or 0, representing the ""ship"" class and ""no-ship"" class, respectively.     - **scene id:** The unique identifier of the PlanetScope visual scene the image chip was extracted from. The scene id can be used with the [Planet API](https://www.planet.com/docs/reference/data-api/) to discover and download the entire scene.    - **longitude_latitude:** The longitude and latitude coordinates of the image center point, with values separated by a single underscore.      The dataset is also distributed as a JSON formatted text file `shipsnet.json`. The loaded object contains **data**, **label**, **scene_ids**, and **location** lists.      The pixel value data for each 80x80 RGB image is stored as a list of 19200 integers within the **data** list. The first 6400 entries contain the red channel values, the next 6400 the green, and the final 6400 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 80 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.     The list values at index *i* in **labels**, **scene_ids**, and **locations** each correspond to the *i*-th image in the **data** list.     Class Labels       The ""ship"" class includes 1000 images. Images in this class are near-centered on the body of a single ship. Ships of different sizes, orientations, and atmospheric collection conditions are included. Example images from this class are shown below.      ![ship](https://i.imgur.com/tLsSoTz.png)     The ""no-ship"" class includes 3000 images. A third of these are a random sampling of different landcover features - water, vegetion, bare earth, buildings, etc. - that do not include any portion of an ship. The next third are ""partial ships"" that contain only a portion of an ship, but not enough to meet the full definition of the ""ship"" class. The last third are images that have previously been mislabeled by machine learning models, typically caused by bright pixels or strong linear features. Example images from this class are shown below.     ![no-plane](https://imgur.com/Q3daQMC.png)     Acknowledgements    Satellite imagery used to build this dataset is made available through Planet\'s [Open California](https://www.planet.com/products/open-california/) dataset, which is [openly licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/329,A global database of radiogenic Nd and Sr isotopes in marine and terrestrial samples (V. 2.0),"The database presented here contains radiogenic neodymium and strontium isotope ratios measured on both terrestrial and marine sediments. It was compiled to help assessing sediment provenance and transport processes for various time intervals. This can be achieved by either mapping sediment isotopic signature and/or fingerprinting source areas using statistical tools (e.g. Blanchet, 2018b, 2018a).          The database has been built by incorporating data from the literature and the SedDB database and harmonizing the metadata, especially units and geographical coordinates. The original data were processed in three steps. Firstly, a specific attention has been devoted to provide geographical coordinates to each sample in order to be able to map the data. When available, the original geographical coordinates from the reference (generally DMS coordinates, with different precision standard) were transferred into the decimal degrees system. When coordinates were not provided, an approximate location was derived from available information in the original publication. Secondly, all samples were assigned a set of standardized criteria that help splitting the dataset in specific categories. We defined categories associated with the sample location (""Region"", ""Sub-region"", ""Location"", which relate to location at continental to city/river scale) or with the sample types (terrestrial samples – “aerosols”, “soil sediments”, “river sediments”, “rocks” - or marine samples –“marine sediment” or “trap sample”). Thirdly, samples were discriminated according to their deposition age, which allowed to compute average values for specific time intervals (see attached table ""Age_determination_Sediment_Cores_V2.txt""). A first version of the database was published in September 2018 and presented data for the African sector. A second version was published in April 2019, in which the dataset has been extended to reach a global extent. The dataset will be further updated bi-annually to increase the geographical resolution and/or add other type of samples.          This dataset consists of two tab separated tables: ""Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V2.txt"" and ""Age_determination_Sediment_Cores_V2.txt"". ""Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V2.txt"" contains the assembled dataset of marine and terrestrial Nd and/or Sr concentration and isotopes, together with sorting criteria and geographical locations. ""Age_determination_Sediment_Cores_V2.txt"" contains all background information concerning the determination of the isotopic signature of specific time intervals (depth interval, number of samples, mean and standard deviation). Column headers are explained in respective metadata comma-separated files. A full reference list is provided in the file “References_Database_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V2.rtf”. Finally, R code for mapping the data and running statistical analyses is also available for this dataset (Blanchet, 2018b, 2018a).","EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; EROSION/SEDIMENTATION &gt; EROSION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; PALEOCLIMATE &gt; PALEOCLIMATE RECONSTRUCTIONS &gt; DROUGHT/PRECIPITATION RECONSTRUCTION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; SOLID EARTH &gt; GEOCHEMISTRY &gt; GEOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES &gt; ISOTOPE RATIOS,  Mapping tool,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; PALEOCLIMATE &gt; OCEAN/LAKE RECORDS &gt; ISOTOPES,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; EROSION/SEDIMENTATION &gt; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,  Neodymium radioisotopes,  EARTH SCIENCE SERVICES &gt; DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION &gt; STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; PALEOCLIMATE &gt; LAND RECORDS &gt; SEDIMENTS,  Strontium radioisotopes"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/333,Multivariate alternating decision tree,"Decision trees are characterized by fast induction time and comprehensible classification rules. However, their classification accuracies are relatively lower in comparison to other black-box classifiers such as support vector machines. It is often possible to improve decision tree accuracies by combining them via boosting or bagging to form an ensemble of trees (i.e., forests). Unfortunately, ensemble approaches will cause the decision trees to lose their comprehensibility and significantly lengthen their induction time.      The invention of the alternating decision tree (ADTree) allows the incorporation of boosting within a single decision tree to retain comprehensibility. However, the existing ADTree is univariate in nature which limits its potential to further improve the accuracy and induction time.      This thesis presents the multivariate alternating decision tree, whereby multivariate decision nodes are incorporated into the ADTree learning algorithm. It can be considered as a generalization of the existing univariate ADTree. Three different variants of multivariate ADTrees are presented in this thesis, namely the Fisher’s ADTree, Sparse ADTree and regularized LogitBoost ADTree (rLADTree). These algorithms were benchmarked against other existing univariate, multivariate and ensemble-based decision trees using real-world datasets from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository and University of Eastern Finland Spectral Database.      It is shown that the Fisher’s ADTree is capable of improving the accuracy of multivariate decision trees through boosting. At the same time it remains to be significantly smaller than boosted multivariate decision trees. It is also shown that the Sparse ADTree is a non-parametric extension of the Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (SLDA). It is therefore able to linearly partition the data when it is beneficial to do so, or to grow a tree to improve the classification accuracy when necessary. The most notable multivariate ADTree variant is the regularized LADTree, which is characterized by having no statistically significant differences in all performance metrics and offering comprehensibility when compared with the univariate, unboosted decision trees like C4.5 and CART for general datasets. For datasets with highly correlated features, the regularized LADTree outperforms the existing decision trees in terms of accuracy and comprehensibility, making it a top choice among decision tree classifiers.",Uncategorized

In one hand to mush inventory means working capital costs, operational costs and a complex operation. On the other hand lack of inventory leads to lost sales, unhappy customers and a damaged brand.     Current inventory management models have many solutions to place the correct order, but they are all based in a single unknown factor: the demand for the next periods.

Abstract: Conceptual knowledge of key principles underlying arithmetic is an important precursor to understanding algebra and later success in mathematics. One such principle is associativity, which allows individuals to solve problems in different ways by decomposing and recombining subexpressions (e.g. ‘a + b – c’ = ‘b – c + a’). More than any other principle, children and adults alike have difficulty understanding it, and educators have called for this to change. We report three intervention studies that were conducted in university classrooms to investigate whether adults’ use of associativity could be improved. In all three studies, it was found that those who first solved inversion problems (e.g. ‘a + b – b’) were more likely than controls to then use associativity on ‘a + b – c’ problems. We suggest that ‘a + b – b’ inversion problems may either direct spatial attention to the location of ‘b – c’ on associativity problems, or implicitly communicate the validity and efficiency of a right-to-left strategy. These findings may be helpful for those designing brief activities that aim to aid the understanding of arithmetic principles and algebra.",170299 Cognitive Science not elsewhere classified

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/352,Cryptocurrency Historical Prices," Context     Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it and [this post][1] helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the data scientist inside me started raising questions like:     1. How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?    2. Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days?      For getting answers to all these questions (and if possible to predict the future prices ;)), I started collecting data from [coinmarketcap][2] about the cryptocurrencies.        So what next?     Now that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to [Blockchain Info][3], I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.     This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/357,Batch Effects Correction with Unknown Subtypes,"High-throughput experimental data are accumulating exponentially in public databases. Unfortunately, however, mining valid scientific discoveries from these abundant resources is hampered by technical artifacts and inherent biological heterogeneity. The former are usually termed “batch effects,” and the latter is often modeled by subtypes. Existing methods either tackle batch effects provided that subtypes are known or cluster subtypes assuming that batch effects are absent. Consequently, there is a lack of research on the correction of batch effects with the presence of unknown subtypes. Here, we combine a location-and-scale adjustment model and model-based clustering into a novel hybrid one, the batch-effects-correction-with-unknown-subtypes model (BUS). BUS is capable of (a) correcting batch effects explicitly, (b) grouping samples that share similar characteristics into subtypes, (c) identifying features that distinguish subtypes, (d) allowing the number of subtypes to vary from batch to batch, (e) integrating batches from different platforms, and (f) enjoying a linear-order computation complexity. We prove the identifiability of BUS and provide conditions for study designs under which batch effects can be corrected. BUS is evaluated by simulation studies and a real breast cancer dataset combined from three batches measured on two platforms. Results from the breast cancer dataset offer much better biological insights than existing methods. We implement BUS as a free Bioconductor package BUScorrect.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/358,"Time series of streamflow occurrence from 182 sites in ephemeral, intermittent and perennial streams in the Attert catchment, Luxembourg","We used different sensing techniques including time-lapse imagery, electric conductivity and stage measurements to generate a combined dataset of presence and absence of streamflow within a large number of nested sub-catchments in the Attert Catchment, Luxembourg. The first sites of observation were established in 2013 and successively extended to a total number of 182 in 2016 as part of the project “Catchments As Organized Systems” (CAOS, Zehe et al., 2014). Setup for time-lapse imagery measurements was inspired by Gilmore et al. (2013) while the setup for EC-sensor was proposed by Chapin et al. (2014). Temporal resolution ranged from 5 to 15 minutes intervals. Each single dataset was carefully processed and quality controlled before the time interval was homogenized to 30 minutes. The dataset provides valuable information of the dynamics of a meso-scale stream network in space and time.          The Attert basin is located in the border region of Luxembourg and Belgium and covers an area of 247 km². The elevation of the catchment ranges from 245 m a.s.l. in Useldange to 549 m a.s.l. in the Ardennes. Climate conditions across the catchment are rather similar in terms of temperature and precipitation. Hydrological regimes are mainly driven by seasonal fluctuations in evapotranspiration causing flow to cease in intermittent reaches during dry periods. The catchment covers three predominant geologies: Slate, Marls and Sandstone. The dataset features data from catchments covering all geological characteristics from single geology to mixed geology. It can be used to test and evaluate hydrologic models, but also for the assessment of the intermittent stream ecosystem in the Attert basin.","EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SURFACE WATER &gt; DISCHARGE/FLOW,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SURFACE WATER &gt; RIVERS/STREAMS,  In Situ/Laboratory Instruments &gt; Conductivity Sensors &gt; CONDUCTIVITY METERS,  In Situ/Laboratory Instruments &gt; Gauges &gt; STREAM GAUGES,  Catchments as Organised Systems,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SURFACE WATER &gt; HYDROPATTERN,  CAOS,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SURFACE WATER &gt; DRAINAGE,  In Situ/Laboratory Instruments &gt; Photon/Optical Detectors &gt; Cameras &gt; CAMERA"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/367,Multidimensional Poverty Measures," Context     Most countries of the world define poverty as a lack of money. Yet poor people themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer from multiple disadvantages at the same time – for example they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty.     Multidimensional poverty measures can be used to create a more comprehensive picture. They reveal who is poor and how they are poor – the range of different disadvantages they experience. As well as providing a headline measure of poverty, multidimensional measures can be broken down to reveal the poverty level in different areas of a country, and among different sub-groups of people.       Content     Most recent MPI data harmonized for comparisons across time.     OPHI researchers apply the AF method and related multidimensional measures to a range of different countries and contexts. Their analyses span a number of different topics, such as changes in multidimensional poverty over time, comparisons in rural and urban poverty, and inequality among the poor. For more information on OPHI’s research, see our [working paper series](http://www.ophi.org.uk/resources/ophi-working-papers/) and [research briefings](http://www.ophi.org.uk/resources/briefing-documents/).     OPHI also calculates the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index [MPI](http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/), which has been published since 2010 in the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Report. The Global MPI is an internationally-comparable measure of acute poverty covering more than 100 developing countries. It is updated by OPHI twice a year and constructed using the AF method.     The Alkire Foster (AF) method is a way of measuring multidimensional poverty developed by OPHI’s Sabina Alkire and James Foster. Building on the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty measures, it involves counting the different types of deprivation that individuals experience at the same time, such as a lack of education or employment, or poor health or living standards. These deprivation profiles are analysed to identify who is poor, and then used to construct a multidimensional index of poverty (MPI). For free online video guides on how to use the AF method, see [OPHI’s online training portal](http://www.ophi.org.uk/teaching/online-training-portal/).     To identify the poor, the AF method counts the overlapping or simultaneous deprivations that a person or household experiences in different indicators of poverty. The indicators may be equally weighted or take different weights. People are identified as multidimensionally poor if the weighted sum of their deprivations is greater than or equal to a poverty cut off – such as 20%, 30% or 50% of all deprivations.     It is a flexible approach which can be tailored to a variety of situations by selecting different dimensions (e.g. education), indicators of poverty within each dimension (e.g. how many years schooling a person has) and poverty cut offs (e.g. a person with fewer than five years of education is considered deprived).     The most common way of measuring poverty is to calculate the percentage of the population who are poor, known as the headcount ratio (H). Having identified who is poor, the AF method generates a unique class of poverty measures (Mα) that goes beyond the simple headcount ratio. Three measures in this class are of high importance:     Adjusted headcount ratio (M0), otherwise known as the MPI: This measure reflects both the incidence of poverty (the percentage of the population who are poor) and the intensity of poverty (the percentage of deprivations suffered by each person or household on average).

Additional data [here](http://ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/global-mpi-2017/mpi-data/).     This dataset contains the [Summer 2016 Subnational data from Table 6.3](http://ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/mpi-resources/2016) as it is the most recent dataset for MPI comparisons over time.      Data Cleaning Notes     The original format was significantly different in many unusable ways.      I converted all survey years (`year1` and `year2`) from a `Period` format that looked some like ""2005/6 - 2009"". Note, ""2005/6"" meant the survey was conducted from sometime in 2005 through sometime in 2006. Additionally, the `year2` aspect could follow a similar format (eg ""2009/10""). To keep simplicity, I dropped the `/%s` portion of both `year1` and `year2`. This still maintains consistency in the case that either year column becomes used for a comparison statistic.     The raw data file from OPHI has their `Total Population` and `Number of Poor` in Thousands. I converted the decimals to make it a raw population number. For example, `3.142` becomes `3142`.     The original file is in an excel format that needed to be converted into a `csv` in order to upload into Kaggle. I decided to keep values to the`10^-6` decimal place.     The statistical significance columns comes from OPHI\'s test of significant changes. Directly from the excel file:      `Note, *** statistically significant at α=0.01, ** statistically significant at  α=0.05, * statistically significant at α=0.10`      Acknowledgements     Alkire, S. and Robles, G.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/396,Introduction to Machine Learning,"Machine learning has emerged as a discipline that enables computers to assist humans in making sense of large and complex data sets. With the drop-in cost of sequencing technologies, large amounts of omics data are being generated and made accessible to researchers. Analysing these complex high-volume data is not trivial and the use of classical tools cannot explore their full potential. Machine learning can thus be very useful in mining large omics datasets to uncover new insights that can advance the field of medicine and improve health care.The aim of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the Machine learning (ML) taxonomy and common machine learning algorithms. The tutorial will cover the methods being used to analyse different omics data sets by providing a practical context through the use of basic but widely used R and Python libraries. The tutorial will comprise a number of hands on exercises and challenges, where the participants will acquire a first understanding of the standard ML processes as well as the practical skills in applying them on familiar problems and publicly available real-world data sets."," 170203 Knowledge Representation and Machine Learning, 60102 Bioinformatics,  80109 Pattern Recognition and Data Mining"

Here are some ideas for you:     **The Holy Grail...**    ... is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I\'ve achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game, you\'ve got to know     that the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision.      **Probabilities vs Odds**     When running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions.     **Explore and visualize features**     With access to players and teams attributes, team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights into [The Beautiful Game][6] .

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/401,Overwatch,"Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.       Overwatch puts players into two teams of six, with each player selecting one of several pre-defined hero characters with unique movement, attributes, and abilities; these heroes are divided into four classes: Offense, Defense, Tank and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map and/or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they continue to play in matches. The game was launched with casual play, while Blizzard added competitive ranked play about a month after launch. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.

Earth System Science Data, 11(2), 515-527","The expected sea level rise by the year 2100 will determine an adaptation of the whole coastal system and the land retreat of the shoreline. Future scenarios coupled with the improving of mining technologies will favour an increased exploitation of sand deposits for nourishments, especially for urban beaches and sandy coasts with lowlands behind. Objective of the work is to provide useful tools to support planning actions in the management of sand deposits located in the continental shelf of western Sardinia (western Mediterranean Sea). The work has been realized through the integration of data and information collected during several projects. Available data consist of morpho-bathymetric data (multibeam) associated with morphoacoustic (backscatter) data, collected in the depth range -25 to -700 m. Extensive coverage of high-resolution seismic profiles (Chirp 3.5 kHz) have been acquired along the continental shelf. Also surface sediment samples (Van Veen grab and box corer) and vibrocores have been collected. These data allow mapping of the submerged sand deposits with the determination of their thickness and volumes, and their sedimentological characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible to map the seabed geomorphological features of the continental shelf of western Sardinia. All the available data (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.895430) have been integrated and organized in a geodatabase implemented through a GIS and the software suite Geoinformation Enabling Toolkit StarterKit ® (GET-IT), developed by researchers of the Italian National Research Council for RITMARE project. GET-IT facilitates the creation of distributed nodes of an interoperable Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) and enables unskilled researchers from various scientific domains to create their own Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard services for distributing geospatial data, observations and metadata of sensors and datasets.Data distribution through standard services follows the guidelines of the European Directive INSPIRE (DIRECTIVE 2007/2/EC); in particular, standard metadata describe each map level, containing identifiers such as data type, origin, property, quality, processing processes to foster data searching and quality assessment.",

Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.     The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. ""If it doesn\'t work on MNIST, it won\'t work at all"", they said. ""Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.""     Zalando seeks to replace the original MNIST dataset      Content     Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.     - To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix.     - For example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top, as in the ascii-diagram below.          **Labels**     Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:     - 0 T-shirt/top    - 1 Trouser    - 2 Pullover    - 3 Dress    - 4 Coat    - 5 Sandal    - 6 Shirt    - 7 Sneaker    - 8 Bag    - 9 Ankle boot         TL;DR     - Each row is a separate image      - Column 1 is the class label.     - Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).     - Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)      Acknowledgements     - Original dataset was downloaded from [https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist][1]     - Dataset was converted to CSV with this script: [https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/][2]      License     The MIT License (MIT) Copyright © [2017] Zalando SE, https://tech.zalando.com     Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Earth System Science Data, 9(2), 601-613","The Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) is a database for the central storage of the worldwide measured energy fluxes at the Earth\'s surface, maintained at ETH Zurich (Switzerland). This paper documents the status of the GEBA version 2017 dataset, presents the new web interface and user access, and reviews the scientific impact that GEBA data had in various applications. GEBA has continuously been expanded and updated and contains in its 2017 version around 500.000 monthly mean entries of various surface energy balance components measured at 2500 locations. The database contains observations from 15 surface energy flux components, with the most widely measured quantity available in GEBA being the shortwave radiation incident at the Earth\'s surface (global radiation). Many of the historic records extend over several decades. GEBA contains monthly data from a variety of sources, namely from the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) in St. Petersburg, from national weather services, from different research networks (BSRN, ARM, SURFRAD), from peer-reviewed publications, project and data reports, and from personal communications. Quality checks are applied to test for gross errors in the dataset. GEBA has played a key role in various research applications, such as in the quantification of the global energy balance, in the discussion of the anomalous atmospheric shortwave absorption, and in the detection of multi-decadal variations in global radiation, known as ""global dimming"" and ""brightening"". GEBA is further extensively used for the evaluation of climate models and satellite-derived surface flux products. On a more applied level, GEBA provides the basis for engineering applications in the context of solar power generation, water management, agricultural production and tourism.

The data can be used in the following ways:     -Understand the demand for certain professions, job titles, or industries    -Help universities with curriculum development    -Identify skills that are most frequently required by employers, and how the distribution of  necessary skills changes over time    -Make recommendations to job seekers and employers     Past research    We have used association rules mining and simple text mining techniques to analyze the data.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/427,Predict Angina,"Many women who are initially thought to have angina turn out to have normal coronary angiograms, that is they are found not to have angina after all. A study was carried out to assess the feasibility of a preliminary screening test. For a large number of patients who were thought to have angina, information on a number of possible risk factors was collected and then their subsequent angina status was recorded. The data is available as an R data frame entitled angina and contains the following information:     status: whether woman turns out to have angina (yes/no)    age: age of a \u200bwoman    smoke: smoking status (1=current-, 2=ex-, 3=non-smoker)    cig: current average number of cigarettes per day    hyper: hypertension (1=absent, 2=mild, 3=moderate)    angfam: family history of angina (yes/no)    myofam: family history of myocardial infarction (yes/no)    strokefam: family history of stroke (yes/no)    diabetes: does woman have diabetes? (yes/no)    Missing values are coded as NA.     The main aim of this study was to try to find out which, if any, of the health variables, are associated with angina and whether some subset of them could be used to help predict the dependent variable angina status. The accompanying document on the `Model selection through backward elimination’ is going to be useful for that purpose. More specifically, it would be helpful to be able to estimate the risk/probability that a woman with a particular combination of these health variables truly has angina. If such a scheme of estimating risks can be constructed, is it likely to be useful? i.e. is it good at predicting whether a woman has angina or not (since the treatment of angina is expensive)? In addition, it would be of interest to estimate the individual effects of important variables. For example, if smoking seems to be a risk factor, then what is the odds of a smoker having angina relative to a non-smoker? What about ex-smokers and light smokers?","small,  cardiovascular diseases"

The 30 m base map was improved from FROM-GLC-agg with additional coarse resolution datasets (i.e., MCD12Q1 (Friedl et al., 2010), GlobCover2009 (Bontemps et al., 2010) etc.) to reduce land cover type confusion. Around 1.1% pixels were replaced by coarse resolution products. Validation based assessments indicate the accuracy for land cover maps at 30 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km resolutions are 69.50%, 76.65%, 74.65%, and 73.47%, respectively. Further analysis of area-estimation biases for different land cover types at different resolutions suggests that maps at coarser than 5 km resolution contain at least 5% area estimation error for most land cover types. Proportion layers, which contain precise information on land cover percentage, are suggested for use when coarser resolution land cover data are required.Please refer to the classification system at http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn/.",120504 Land Use and Environmental Planning

People with musical training may notice that, to some degree, it resemble the notes of a musical scale. Taking advantage of these similarities, and using only rsfMRI data as input, we use basic rules of music theory to transform the data into musical form. Our project is implemented in Python using the midiutil library. We used open rsfMRI from the ABIDE dataset preprocessed by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project. We randomly chose 10 individual datasets preprocessed using C-PAC pipeline with 4 different strategies. To reduce the data dimensionality, we used the CC200 atlas to downsample voxels to 200 regions-of-interest. A framework for generating music from fMRI data, based on music theory, was developed and implemented as a Python tool yielding several audio files. When listening to the results, we noticed that music differed across individual datasets. However, music generated by the same individual (4 preprocessing strategies) remained similar. Our results sound different from music obtained in a similar study using EEG and fMRI data."," Neuroscience, Imaging"

This dataset is no longer being updated, and web access will be removed on October 1, 2019.After many years of research and technical preparation, the production of a new ECMWF climate reanalysis to replace ERA-Interim is in progress. ERA5 is the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate, which started with the FGGE reanalyses produced in the 1980s, followed by ERA-15, ERA-40 and most recently ERA-Interim. ERA5 will cover the period January 1950 to near real time, though the first segment of data to be released will span the period 2010-2016.ERA5 is produced using high-resolution forecasts (HRES) at 31 kilometer resolution (one fourth the spatial resolution of the operational model) and a 62 kilometer resolution ten member 4D-Var ensemble of data assimilation (EDA) in CY41r2 of ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) with 137 hybrid sigma-pressure (model) levels in the vertical, up to a top level of 0.01 hPa. Atmospheric data on these levels are interpolated to 37 pressure levels (the same levels as in ERA-Interim). Surface or single level data are also available, containing 2D parameters such as precipitation, 2 meter temperature, top of atmosphere radiation and vertical integrals over the entire atmosphere. The IFS is coupled to a soil model, the parameters of which are also designated as surface parameters, and an ocean wave model. Generally, the data is available at an hourly frequency and consists of analyses and short (18 hour) forecasts, initialized twice daily from analyses at 06 and 18 UTC. Most analyses parameters are also available from the forecasts. There are a number of forecast parameters, e.g. mean rates and accumulations, that are not available from the analyses.Improvements to ERA5, compared to ERA-Interim, include use of HadISST.2, reprocessed ECMWF climate data records (CDR), and implementation of RTTOV11 radiative transfer. Variational bias corrections have not only been applied to satellite radiances, but also ozone retrievals, aircraft observations, surface pressure, and radiosonde profiles.NCAR's Data Support Section (DSS) is performing and supplying a grid transformed version of ERA5, in which variables originally represented as spectral coefficients or archived on a reduced Gaussian grid are transformed to a regular 1280 longitude by 640 latitude N320 Gaussian grid. In addition, DSS is also computing horizontal winds (u-component, v-component) from spectral vorticity and divergence where these are available. Finally, the data is reprocessed into single parameter time series.Please note: As of November 2017, DSS is also producing a CF 1.6 compliant netCDF-4/HDF5 version of ERA5 for CISL RDA at NCAR. The netCDF-4/HDF5 version is the de facto RDA ERA5 online data format. The GRIB1 data format is only available via NCAR's High Performance Storage System (HPSS). We encourage users to evaluate the netCDF-4/HDF5 version for their work, and to use the currently existing GRIB1 files as a reference and basis of comparison. To ease this transition, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the netCDF-4/HDF5 and GRIB1 files, with as much GRIB1 metadata as possible incorporated into the attributes of the netCDF-4/HDF5 counterpart."," EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; TOPOGRAPHY &gt; SURFACE ROUGHNESS,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; PRECIPITATION &gt; PRECIPITATION AMOUNT,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; WIND DYNAMICS &gt; VERTICAL WIND VELOCITY/SPEED,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE &gt; UPPER AIR TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE &gt; SURFACE TEMPERATURE &gt; AIR TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ALTITUDE &gt; GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE &gt; SEA LEVEL PRESSURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; PRECIPITATION &gt; SOLID PRECIPITATION &gt; SNOW,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; BIOSPHERE &gt; VEGETATION &gt; VEGETATION COVER,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; SURFACE WINDS,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR &gt; WATER VAPOR INDICATORS &gt; DEW POINT TEMPERATURE, EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SURFACE WATER &gt; SURFACE WATER PROCESSES/MEASUREMENTS &gt; RUNOFF,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SNOW/ICE &gt; SNOW/ICE TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SNOW/ICE &gt; SNOW MELT,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SNOW/ICE &gt; SNOW DEPTH,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SNOW/ICE &gt; SNOW DENSITY,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE &gt; SNOW/ICE &gt; ALBEDO,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; OCEANS &gt; SEA ICE &gt; ICE EXTENT,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; OCEANS &gt; OCEAN TEMPERATURE &gt; SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; TOPOGRAPHY &gt; TERRAIN ELEVATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SURFACE THERMAL PROPERTIES &gt; SKIN TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SURFACE RADIATIVE PROPERTIES &gt; ALBEDO,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL MOISTURE/WATER CONTENT,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; LAND SURFACE &gt; SOILS &gt; SOIL CLASSIFICATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; CRYOSPHERE &gt; SNOW/ICE &gt; SNOW/ICE TEMPERATURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; BIOSPHERE &gt; VEGETATION &gt; VEGETATION SPECIES,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; CLOUDS &gt; CLOUD PROPERTIES &gt; CLOUD FREQUENCY,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; CLOUDS &gt; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS &gt; CLOUD LIQUID WATER/ICE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; WIND DYNAMICS &gt; WIND STRESS,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; WIND DYNAMICS &gt; VORTICITY,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; WIND DYNAMICS &gt; CONVERGENCE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; WIND DYNAMICS &gt; CONVECTION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WINDS &gt; UPPER LEVEL WINDS,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR &gt; WATER VAPOR PROCESSES &gt; EVAPORATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR &gt; WATER VAPOR INDICATORS &gt; WATER VAPOR,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR &gt; WATER VAPOR INDICATORS &gt; TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR &gt; WATER VAPOR INDICATORS &gt; HUMIDITY,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION &gt; SHORTWAVE RADIATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION &gt; OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION &gt; LONGWAVE RADIATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION &gt; INCOMING SOLAR RADIATION,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION &gt; HEAT FLUX,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE &gt; SURFACE PRESSURE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE &gt; GRAVITY WAVE,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; ALTITUDE &gt; PLANETARY BOUNDARY LAYER HEIGHT,  EARTH SCIENCE &gt; ATMOSPHERE &gt; AIR QUALITY &gt; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE"

Earth System Science Data, 10(4), 1807-1827","Knowledge about the coverage and characteristics of glaciers in High Mountain Asia is still incomplete and heterogeneous. However, several applications such as modelling of past or future glacier development, runoff or glacier volume, rely on the existence and accessibility of complete datasets. In particular, precise outlines of glacier extent are required to spatially constrain glacier-specific calculations such as length, area and volume changes or flow velocities. As a contribution to the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) and the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) glacier database, we have produced a homogeneous inventory of the Pamir and the Karakoram mountain ranges using 28 Landsat TM and ETM+ scenes acquired around the year 2000. We applied a standardized method of automated digital glacier mapping and manual correction using coherence images from ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 as an additional source of information; we then separated the glacier complexes into individual glaciers using drainage divides derived by watershed analysis from the ASTER GDEM2, and separately delineated all debris-covered areas. Assessment of uncertainties was performed for debris-covered and clean-ice glacier parts using the buffer method and independent multiple digitizing of three glaciers representing key challenges such as shadows and debris cover. Indeed, along with seasonal snow at high elevations, shadow and debris cover represent the largest uncertainties in our final dataset. In total, we mapped more than 27'800 glaciers &gt;0.02 km² covering an area of 35'520 ±1948 km² and an elevation range from 2260 m to 8600 m. Regional median glacier elevations vary from 4150 m (Pamir Alai) to almost 5400 m (Karakoram), which is largely due to differences in temperature and precipitation. Supraglacial debris covers an area of 3587 ±662 km², i.e. 10% of the total glacierised area. Larger glaciers have a higher share in debris-covered area (up to &gt;20%), making it an important factor to be considered in subsequent applications.",

While a double peak is visible for energy of irradiation greater than or equal to 200 micro joules with larger plume length, 100 microjoules shows a single peak with low emission counts and low spatial expansion. Also, emission count corresponding to fast peaks is always less when compared to its slowcounterpart in each case. To compare all the graphs, the emission count is normalized using the maximum emission count in all the data sets (which is the DP 100 case).","20299 Atomic,  Molecular,  Nuclear,  Particle and Plasma Physics not elsewhere classified"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/468,Football Events,"Context    -------------    Most publicly available football (soccer) statistics are limited to aggregated data such as Goals, Shots, Fouls, Cards. When assessing performance or building predictive models, this simple aggregation, without any context, can be misleading. For example, a team that produced 10 shots on target from long range has a lower chance of scoring than a club that produced the same amount of shots from inside the box. However, metrics derived from this simple count of shots will similarly asses the two teams.     A football game generates much more events and it is very important and interesting to take into account the context in which those events were generated. This dataset should keep sports analytics enthusiasts awake for long hours as the number of questions that can be asked is huge.     Content    -------    This dataset is a result of a very tiresome effort of webscraping and integrating different data sources. The central element is the text commentary. All the events were derived by reverse engineering the text commentary, using regex. Using this, I was able to derive 11 types of events, as well as the main player and secondary player involved in those events and many other statistics. In case I've missed extracting some useful information, you are gladly invited to do so and share your findings. The dataset provides a granular view of 9,074 games, totaling 941,009 events from the biggest 5 European football (soccer) leagues: England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France from 2011/2012 season to 2016/2017 season as of 25.01.2017.    There are games that have been played during these seasons for which I could not collect detailed data. Overall, over 90% of the played games during these seasons have event data.      The dataset is organized in 3 files:      - **events.csv** contains event data about each game. Text commentary was scraped from: bbc.com, espn.com and onefootball.com     -   **ginf.csv** - contains metadata and market odds about each game. odds were collected from oddsportal.com     - **dictionary.txt** contains a dictionary with the textual description of each categorical variable coded with integers      Past Research    -------------    I have used this data to:      - create predictive models for football games in order to bet on football outcomes.     - make visualizations about upcoming games     - build expected goals models and compare players     Inspiration    -----------    There are tons of interesting questions a sports enthusiast can answer with this dataset. For example:      - What is the value of a shot? Or what is the probability of a shot being a goal given it's location, shooter, league, assist method, gamestate, number of players on the pitch, time - known as expected goals (xG) models     - When are teams more likely to score?     - Which teams are the best or sloppiest at holding the lead?     - Which teams or players make the best use of set pieces?     - In which leagues is the referee more likely to give a card?     - How do players compare when they shoot with their week foot versus strong foot? Or which players are ambidextrous?     - Identify different styles of plays (shooting from long range vs shooting from the box, crossing the ball vs passing the ball, use of headers)     - Which teams have a bias for attacking on a particular flank?

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/472,Arabic Natural Audio Dataset,"Emotion expression is an essential part of human interaction. The same text can hold different meanings when expressed with different emotions. Thus understanding the text alone is not enough for getting the meaning of an utterance. Acted and natural corpora have been used to detect emotions from speech. Many speech databases for different languages including English, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Italian, Swedish and Spanish exist for modeling emotion recognition. Since there is no reported reference of an available Arabic corpus, we decided to collect the first Arabic Natural Audio Dataset (ANAD) to recognize discrete emotions.     Embedding an effective emotion detection feature in speech recognition system seems a promising solution for decreasing the obstacles faced by the deaf when communicating with the outside world. There exist several applications that allow the deaf to make and receive phone calls normally, as the hearing-impaired individual can type a message and the person on the other side hears the words spoken, and as they speak, the words are received as text by the deaf individual. However, missing the emotion part still makes these systems not hundred percent reliable. Having an effective speech to text and text to speech system installed in their everyday life starting from a very young age will hopefully replace the human ear. Such systems will aid deaf people to enroll in normal schools at very young age and will help them to adapt better in classrooms and with their classmates. It will help them experience a normal childhood and hence grow up to be able to integrate within the society without external help.      Eight videos of live calls between an anchor and a human outside the studio were downloaded from online Arabic talk shows. Each video was then divided into turns: callers and receivers. To label each video, 18 listeners were asked to listen to each video and select whether they perceive a happy, angry or surprised emotion. Silence, laughs and noisy chunks were removed. Every chunk was then automatically divided into 1 sec speech units forming our final corpus composed of 1384 records.     Twenty five acoustic features, also known as low-level descriptors, were extracted. These features are: intensity, zero crossing rates, MFCC 1-12 (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), F0 (Fundamental frequency) and F0 envelope, probability of voicing and, LSP frequency 0-7. On every feature nineteen statistical functions were applied. The functions are: maximum, minimum, range, absolute position of maximum, absolute position of minimum, arithmetic of mean, Linear Regression1, Linear Regression2, Linear RegressionA, Linear RegressionQ, standard Deviation, kurtosis, skewness, quartiles 1, 2, 3 and, inter-quartile ranges 1-2, 2-3, 1-3. The delta coefficient for every LLD is also computed as an estimate of the first derivative hence leading to a total of 950 features.     I would have never reached that far without the help of my supervisors. I warmly thank and appreciate Dr. Rached Zantout, Dr. Lama Hamandi, and Dr. Ziad Osman for their guidance, support and constant supervision."," featured,  medium, Emotion Perception,  Arabic Language,  Speech Analysis"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/515,Facilitating big data meta-analyses for clinical neuroimaging through ENIGMA wrapper scripts,"A vast number of clinical disorders may involve changes in brain structure that are correlated with cognitive function and behavior (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, stroke, etc.). Reliably understanding the relationship between specific brain structures and relevant behaviors in worldwide clinical populations could dramatically improve healthcare decisions around the world. For instance, if a reliable relationship between brain structure after stroke and functional motor ability was established, brain imaging could be used to predict prognosis/recovery potential for individual patients. However, high heterogeneity in clinical populations in both individual neuroanatomy and behavioral outcomes make it difficult to develop accurate models of these potentially subtle relationships.Large neuroimaging studies (n&gt;10,000) would provide unprecedented power to successfully relate clinical neuroanatomy changes with behavioral measures. While these sample sizes might be difficult for any one individual to collect, the ENIGMA Center for WorldwideMedicine, Imaging, and Genomics has successfully pioneered meta- and mega-analytic methods to accomplish this task. ENIGMA brings together a global alliance of over 500 international researchers from over 35 countries to pool together neuroimaging data on different disease states in hopes of discovering critical brain-behavior relationships Individual investigators with relevant data run ENIGMA analysis protocols on their own data and send back an output folder containing the analysis results to be combined with data from other sites for a meta-analysis. In this way, large sample sizes can be acquired without the hassle of large-scale data transfers or actual neuroimaging data sharing.A test dataset is available on request; if interested, please email npnl@usc.edu."," Neuroscience, Imaging"

The software framework makes it easy to add new data sources, simple to define and to provide access to multiple datasets from a single data source. Software dependencies are managed on a per-dataset basis, allowing downloads and examples to use any public packages without requiring installation of packages required by unused datasets. The interface also allows selective download of data (by subject or type) and caches files locally, allowing easy management of big datasets. We focused on exposing new methods for downloading data from the HCP, supporting access via Amazon S3 and HTTP/XNAT. We were able to provide a downloader that accepts login credentials and downloads files locally. We created an example that interacts with DIPY to produce diffusion imaging results on a single subject from the HCP. We also worked at collecting common data sources, as well as individual datasets stored at each data source, into NiData’s “data sources” wiki page.

According to a CART model, it appears that looking at the mean fundamental frequency might be enough to accurately classify a voice. However, some male voices use a higher frequency, even though their resonance differs from female voices, and may be incorrectly classified as female. To the human ear, there is apparently more than simple frequency, that determines a voice's gender.      Questions     - What other features differ between male and female voices?    - Can we find a difference in resonance between male and female voices?    - Can we identify falsetto from regular voices? (separate data-set likely needed for this)    - Are there other interesting features in the data?      CART Diagram     ![CART model][4]     Mean fundamental frequency appears to be an indicator of voice gender, with a threshold of 140hz separating male from female classifications.

It includes information about their character level, race, class, location, and social guild. The Kaggle version of this dataset includes only the information from 2008 (and the dataset in general only includes information from the \'Horde\' faction of players in the game from a single game server).      - Full Dataset Source and Information:       [http://mmnet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/dl/wowah/][1]      - Code used to clean the data: [https://github.com/myles-oneill/WoWAH-parser][2]      Ideas for Using the Dataset    ---------------------------     From the perspective of game system designers, players\' behavior is one of the most important factors they must consider when designing game systems. To gain a fundamental understanding of the game play behavior of online gamers, exploring users\' game play time provides a good starting point. This is because the concept of game play time is applicable to all genres of games and it enables us to model the system workload as well as the impact of system and network QoS on users\' behavior. It can even help us predict players\' loyalty to specific games.     Open Questions    --------------      - Understand user gameplay behavior (game sessions, movement, leveling)     - Understand user interactions (guilds)     - Predict players unsubscribing from the game based on activity     - What are the most popular zones in WoW, what level players tend to inhabit each?     Wrath of the Lich King    ----------------------     An expansion to World of Warcraft, ""Wrath of the Lich King"" (Wotlk) was released on November 13, 2008. It introduced new zones for players to go to, a new character class (the death knight), and a new level cap of 80 (up from 70 previously). This event intersects nicely with the dataset and is probably interesting to investigate.     Map    ---     This dataset doesn\'t include a shapefile (if you know of one that exists, let me know!) to show where the zones the dataset talks about are. Here is a list of zones an information from this version of the game, including their recommended levels: http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Zones_by_level_(original) .      **Update (Version 3)**: [dmi3kno][3] has generously put together some supplementary zone information files which have now been included in this dataset. Some notes about the files:     *Note that some zone names contain Chinese characters. Unicode names are preserved as a key to the original dataset. What this addition will allow is to understand properties of the zones a bit better - their relative location to each other, competititive properties, type of gameplay and, hopefully, their contribution to character leveling. Location coordinates contain some redundant (and possibly duplicate) records as they are collected from different sources. Working with uncleaned location coordinate data will allow users to demonstrate their data wrangling skills (both working with strings and spatial data).*        [1]: http://mmnet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/dl/wowah/      [2]: https://github.com/myles-oneill/WoWAH-parser      [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/dmi3kno"," medium, featured,  culture and arts &gt; games and toys,  ComputingMilieux_PERSONALCOMPUTING,  culture and arts &gt; games and toys &gt; video games"

Atmospheric Environment, 185, 41-52","Lately, black carbon (BC) has received significant attention due to its climate-warming properties and adverse health effects. Nevertheless, long-term observations in urban areas are scarce, most likely because BC monitoring is not required by environmental legislation. This, however, handicaps the evaluation of air quality models which can be used to assess the effectiveness of policy measures which aim at reducing BC concentrations.Here, we present a new dataset of atmospheric BC measurements from Germany constructed from over six million measurements at over 170 stations. Data covering the period between 1994 and 2014 were collected from twelve German federal states and the federal Environment Agency (UBA), quality checked and harmonized into a database with comprehensive metadata. The final data in original time resolution are available for download (link will follow). Though assembled in a consistent way, the dataset is characterized by differences in (a) measurement methodologies for determining evolved carbon and optical absorption, (b) covered time periods, and (c) temporal resolutions that ranged from half hourly to 6-daily measurements. Usage of this dataset thus requires a careful consideration of these differences.Our analysis focuses on 2009, the year with the largest data coverage obtained with one single methodology, as well as on the relative changes in long-term trends over ten years. Stations are grouped into the following categories: urban background, traffic, industrial, and rural. For 2009, we find that BC concentrations at traffic sites were at least twice as high as at urban background, industrial and rural sites. Weekly cycles are most prominent at traffic stations, however, the presence of differences in concentrations during the week and on weekends at other station types suggests that traffic plays an important role throughout the full network. Generally higher concentrations and weaker weekly cycles during the winter months point towards the influence of other sources such as domestic heating. Regarding the long-term trends, advanced statistical techniques allow us to account for instrumentation changes and to separate seasonal and long-term changes in our dataset. Analysis shows a downward trend in BC at nearly all locations and in all conditions, with a high level of confidence for the period of 2005-2014. In depth analysis indicates that background BC is decreasing slowly, while the occurrences of high concentrations are decreasing more rapidly.In summary, legislation - both in Europe and locally - to reduce particulate emissions and indirectly BC appear to be working, based on this analysis. Human health and climate impacts are likely to be diminished because of the improvements in air quality.",

In large-scale data mining, the vast majority    of pairwise comparisons are unlikely to be relevant, meaning that they do not    share a signature of interest. It is therefore essential to efficiently    identify these unproductive comparisons as rapidly as possible to and exclude    them from more time-intensive similarity calculations. The Blazing Signature    Filter (BSF) is a highly efficient pairwise similarity algorithm, which enables    extensive data mining within a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm    transforms datasets into binary metrics, allowing it to utilize the    computationally efficient bit operators and provide a coarse measure of    similarity. As a result, the BSF can scale to high dimensionality and large comparisons    and rapidly filter unproductive pairwise comparison. We present the two LINCS    applications to demonstrate the ability to scale to billions of pairwise    comparisons and the usefulness of this approach."," Computer Software,  80109 Pattern Recognition and Data Mining,  80403 Data Structures, 80301 Bioinformatics Software"

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/555,PRIMAP-crf: UNFCCC CRF data in IPCC 2006 categories,"PRIMAP-crf is a processed version of data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the Common Reporting Format (CRF). The processing has three key aspects: 1) Data from individual countries and years are combined into one file. 2) Data is re-organised to follow the IPCC 2006 hierarchical categorisation. 3) ‘Baskets’ of gases are calculated according to different global warming potential estimates from each of the three most recent IPCC reports.          All Annex I Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are required to report domestic emissions on an annual basis in a 'Common Reporting Format' (CRF). In 2015, the CRF data reporting was updated to follow the more recent 2006 guidelines from the IPCC and the structure of the reporting tables was modified accordingly. However, the hierarchical categorisation of data in the IPCC 2006 guidelines is not readily extracted from the reporting tables. We present the PRIMAP-crf data as a re-constructed hierarchical dataset according to the IPCC 2006 guidelines. Furthermore, the data is organised in a series of tables containing all available countries and years for each GHG individual gas and category reported.          In addition to single gases, the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O, CH4, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3) is provided according to multiple global warming potentials. The dataset was produced using the PRIMAP emissions module. Key processing steps include; extracting data from submitted CRF excel spreadsheets, mapping CRF categories to IPCC 2006 categories, constructing missing categories from available data, and aggregating single gases to gas baskets. The processed data is available under an Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).","UNFCCC,  emissions data"

Humans can grasp the cues like color, expressions on the faces of actors etc to quickly determine the genre (horror, comedy, animation etc). It has been shown that color characteristics of an image like hues, saturation, brightness, contour etc. affect human emotions. A given situation arouses these emotions in humans. If humans are able to predict genre of a movie by a single glance at its poster, then we can assume that the color characteristics, local texture based features and structural cues of posters possess some characteristics which could be utilized in machine learning algorithms to predict its genre.        Content     The movie posters are obtained from IMDB website.  The collected dataset contains IMDB Id, IMDB Link, Title, IMDB Score, Genre and link to download movie posters.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/564,Periodic table of the elements," Context      Observations of particles much smaller than us, and various understandings of those particles, have propelled mankind forward in ways once impossible to imagine. ""The elements"" are what we call the sequential patterns in which some of these particles manifest themselves.     As a chemistry student and a coder, I wanted to do what came naturally to me and make my class a bit easier by coding/automating my way around some of the tedious work involved with calculations. Unfortunately, it seems that chemical-related datasets are not yet a thing which have been conveniently formatted into downloadable databases (as far as my research went). I decided that the elements would be a good place to start data collection, so I did that, and I\'d like to see if this is useful to others as well.     Other related data sets I\'d like to coalesce are some large amount of standard entropies and enthalpies of various compounds, and many of the data sets from the *CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics*. I also think as many diagrams as possible should be documented in a way that can be manipulated and read via code.      Content     Included here are three data sets. Each data set I have included is in three different formats (CSV, JSON, Excel), for a total of nine files.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/579,"CITES Wildlife Trade Database', 'A year in the international wildlife trade"," Context     The **Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora**, or **CITES** for short, is an international treaty organization tasked with monitoring, reporting, and providing recommendations on the international species trade. CITES is a division of the IUCN, which is one of the principal international organization focused on wildlife conversation at large. It is not a part of the UN (though its reports are read closely by the UN).     CITES is one of the oldest conservation organizations in existence. Participation in CITES is voluntary, but almost every member nation in the UN (and, therefore, almost every country worldwide) participates. Countries participating in CITES are obligated to report on roughly 5000 animal species and 29000 plant species brought into or exported out of their countries, and to honor limitations placed on the international trade of these species.     Protected species are organized into three appendixes. Appendix I species are those whose trade threatens them with extinction. Two particularly famous examples of Class I species are the black rhinoceros and the African elephant, whose extremely valuable tusks are an alluring target for poachers exporting ivory abroad. There are 1200 such species. Appendix II species are those not threatened with extinction, but whose trade is nevertheless detrimental. Most species in cites, around 21000 of them, are in Appendix II. Finally, Appendix III animals are those submitted to CITES by member states as a control mechanism. There are about 170 such species, and their export or import requires permits from the submitting member state(s).     This dataset records all <i>legal</i> species imports and exports carried out in 2016 (and a few records from 2017) and reported to CITES. Species not on the CITES lists are not included; nor is the significant, and highly illegal, ongoing black market trading activity.      Content     This dataset contains records on every international import or export conducted with species from the CITES lists in 2016. It contains columns identifying the species, the import and export countries, and the amount and characteristics of the goods being traded (which range from live animals to skins and cadavers).     For further details on individual rows and columns refer to the metadata on the `/data` tab. A much more detailed description of each of the fields is available in the [original CITES documentation](https://trade.cites.org/cites_trade_guidelines/en-CITES_Trade_Database_Guide.pdf).      Acknowledgements     This dataset was originally aggregated by CITES and made available online through [this downloader tool](https://trade.cites.org/en/cites_trade/). The CITES downloader goes back to 1975, however it is only possible to download fully international data two years at a time (or so) due to limitations in the number of rows allowed by the data exporter. If you would like data going further back, check out the downloader. Be warned, though, this data takes a long time to generate!

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/581,Study 2 data,"Dataset connected with article: 'Increasing the use of conceptually-derived strategies in arithmetic: using inversion problems to promote the use of associativity shortcuts.' Abstract: Conceptual knowledge of key principles underlying arithmetic is an important precursor to understanding algebra and later success in mathematics. One such principle is associativity, which allows individuals to solve problems in different ways by decomposing and recombining subexpressions (e.g. ‘a + b – c’ = ‘b – c + a’). More than any other principle, children and adults alike have difficulty understanding it, and educators have called for this to change. We report three intervention studies that were conducted in university classrooms to investigate whether adults’ use of associativity could be improved. In all three studies, it was found that those who first solved inversion problems (e.g. ‘a + b – b’) were more likely than controls to then use associativity on ‘a + b – c’ problems. We suggest that ‘a + b – b’ inversion problems may either direct spatial attention to the location of ‘b – c’ on associativity problems, or implicitly communicate the validity and efficiency of a right-to-left strategy. These findings may be helpful for those designing brief activities that aim to aid the understanding of arithmetic principles and algebra.",170299 Cognitive Science not elsewhere classified

They are planning to introduce some new ones of their own, but first, they want to find out what would be the popularity of the new cars in the market based on each car's attributes.     We will provide you a dataset of cars along with the attributes of each car along with its popularity. Your task is to train a model that can predict the popularity of new cars based on the given attributes.     Dataset    You are given a training dataset, train.csv. The file is a comma separated file with useful information for this task:     train.csv contains the information about a car along with its popularity level. Each row provides information on each car. Information such as buying_price, maintenance_cost, number_of_doors, number_of_seats, etc. The definition of each attribute is as follows:     buying_price: The buying_price denotes the buying price of the car, and it ranges from [1...4], where buying_price equal to 1 represents the lowest price while buying_price equal to 4 represents the highest price.    maintenance_cost: The maintenance_cost denotes the maintenance cost of the car, and it ranges from [1...4], where maintenance_cost equal to 1 represents the lowest cost while maintenance_cost equal to 4 represents the highest cost.    number_of_doors: The number_of_doors denotes the number of doors in the car, and it ranges from [2...5], where each value of number_of_doors represents the number of doors in the car.    number_of_seats: The number_of_seats denotes the number of seats in the car, and it consists of [2, 4, 5], where each value of number_of_seats represents the number of seats in the car.    luggage_boot_size: The luggage_boot_size denotes the luggage boot size, and it ranges from [1...3], where luggage_boot_size equal to 1 represents smallest luggage boot size while luggage_boot_size equal to 3 represents largest luggage boot size.    safety_rating: The safety_rating denotes the safety rating of the car, and it ranges from [1...3], where safety_rating equal to 1 represents low safety while safety_rating equal to 3 represents high safety.    popularity: The popularity denotes the popularity of the car, and it ranges from [1...4], where popularity equal to 1 represents an unacceptable car, popularity equal to 2 represents an acceptable car, popularity equal to 3 represents a good car, and popularity equal to 4 represents the best car.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/585,Drosophila Melanogaster Genome,"Drosophila Melanogaster    -----------------------     Drosophila Melanogaster, the common fruit fly, is a model organism which has been extensively used in entymological research. It is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology.      When its not being used for scientific research, *D. melanogaster* is a common pest in homes, restaurants, and anywhere else that serves food. They are not to be confused with Tephritidae flys (also known as fruit flys).      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster     About the Genome    ----------------     This genome was first sequenced in 2000. It contains four pairs of chromosomes (2,3,4 and X/Y). More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional non-protein-coding DNA.      ![D. melanogaster chromosomes][1]     The genome is maintained and frequently updated at [FlyBase][2]. This dataset is sourced from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics download page. It uses the August 2014 version of the D. melanogaster genome (dm6, BDGP Release 6 + ISO1 MT). http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.htmlfruitfly     Files were modified by Kaggle to be a better fit for analysis on Scripts. This primarily involved turning files into CSV format, with a header row, as well as converting the genome itself from 2bit format into a FASTA sequence file.     Bioinformatics    --------------     Genomic analysis can be daunting to data scientists who haven't had much experience with bioinformatics before. We have tried to give basic explanations to each of the files in this dataset, as well as links to further reading on the biological basis for each. If you haven't had the chance to study much biology before, some light reading (ie wikipedia) on the following topics may be helpful to understand the nuances of the data provided here: [Genetics][3], [Genomics][4] ([Sequencing][5]/[Genome Assembly][6]), [Chromosomes][7], [DNA][8], [RNA][9] ([mRNA][10]/[miRNA][11]), [Genes][12], [Alleles][13], [Exons][14], [Introns][15], [Transcription][16], [Translation][17], [Peptides][18], [Proteins][19], [Gene Regulation][20], [Mutation][21], [Phylogenetics][22], and [SNPs][23].      Of course, if you've got some idea of the basics already - don't be afraid to jump right in!      Learning Bioinformatics    -----------------------     There are a lot of great resources for learning bioinformatics on the web. One cool site is [Rosalind][24] - a platform that gives you bioinformatic coding challenges to complete. You can use Kaggle Scripts on this dataset to easily complete the challenges on Rosalind (and see [Myles' solutions here][25] if you get stuck). We have set up [Biopython][26] on Kaggle's docker image which is a great library to help you with your analyses. Check out their [tutorial here][27] and we've also created [a python notebook with some of the tutorial applied to this dataset][28] as a reference.       Files in this Dataset    ---------------------    <hr>    **Drosophila Melanogaster Genome**      - genome.fa     The assembled genome itself is presented here in [FASTA format][29]. Each chromosome is a different sequence of nucleotides. Repeats from RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeats Finder (with period of 12 or less) are show in lower case; non-repeating sequence is shown in upper case.    <hr>    **Meta Information**     There are 3 additional files with meta information about the genome.      - meta-cpg-island-ext-unmasked.csv     This file contains descriptive information about CpG Islands in the genome.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site      - meta-cytoband.csv     This file describes the positions of cytogenic bands on each chromosome.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics      - meta-simple-repeat.csv     This file describes simple tandem repeats in the genome.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA)    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_repeat    <hr>    **Drosophila Melanogaster mRNA Sequences**     Messenger RNA (mRNA) is an intermediate molecule created as part of the cellular process of converting genomic information into proteins. Some mRNA are never translated into proteins and have functional roles in the cell on their own. Collectively, organism mRNA information is known as a Transcriptome. mRNA files included in this dataset give insight into the activity of genes in the organism.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA      - mrna-genbank.fa     This file includes all mRNA sequences from GenBank associated with Drosophila Melanogaster.     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/      - mrna-refseq.fa     This file includes all mRNA sequences from RefSeq associated with Drosophila Melanogaster.     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/    <hr>    **Gene Predictions**     A gene is a segment of DNA on the genome which, through mRNA, is used to create proteins in the organism. Knowing which parts of DNA are coding (genes) or non-coding is difficult, and a number of different systems for prediction exist. This dataset includes a number of different gene prediction systems applied to the drosophila melanogaster genome.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_prediction      - genes-augustus.csv     AUGUSTUS is a piece of software that predicts genes ab initio using Hidden Markov Models.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC441517/       - genes-genscan.csv     GENSCAN is an older ab initio software for predicting genes.     http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCANinfo.html      - genes-ensembl.csv     - ensembl-gtp.csv     - ensembl-pep.csv     - ensembl-source.csv     - ensembl-to-gene-name.csv     Ensembl provides gene annotation generated by their software Genebuild. This process combines automatic annotation alongside manual curation.     http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/genome_annotation.html     We have also included some supplementary files for these, including predicted protein peptide sequences for each predicted gene.      - genes-refseq.csv     - genes-xeno-refseq.csv     - refseq-link.csv     - refseq-summary.csv     We have included two RefSeq gene predictions in this dataset. The first is based solely on information from the drosophila melanogaster genome. The second (genes-xeno-refseq.csv) uses genes from other organisms as a basis for predicting genes in drosophila melanogaster.     RefSeq RNAs were aligned against the D. melanogaster genome using blat; those with an alignment of less than 15% were discarded. When a single RNA aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was identified. Only alignments having a base identity level within 0.1% of the best and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.     We have also included supplementary files for these which include information about the genes that have been identified.     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/    <hr>     What can you do with this data?    -------------------------------     Genomic data is the foundation of bioinformatics, and there is an incredible array of things you can do with this data. A good place to start is to look at some of the meta supplementary files alongside the genomic sequence itself.      We have a number of different gene prediction systems in the dataset, how do they compare to each other? How do they compare to the mRNA data?      Working back from the refseq-summary.csv file, you can look at genes that code for particular proteins - can you find these genes in the genome?     How much of the genome codes for the mRNA's found in our mRNA data? Of the mRNA's we have, how many map to the predicted genes and the predicted peptided sequence data? How much of the mRNA seems to be protein-coding vs how much looks like it is miRNA? Can you find pre-mRNA or splice variants within the mRNA data? Does meta information like cytogenic bands or CpG sites correspond with splice variants or a lack of mRNA altogether?     Those are just some of many ideas that could get you started.     Looking for Feedback    --------------------     This is the first genomic dataset on Kaggle and we are looking for feedback from our community about how interesting this dataset is to them, or if there are ways we could improve it to better suit analysis. Please post suggestions for supplementary data, future genomes we could host, bioinformatics packages we should include on scripts, and any other feedback on the dataset forum.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/586,"Netflix Prize data', ""Dataset from Netflix's competition to improve their reccommendation algorithm"," Context     Netflix held the Netflix Prize open competition for the best algorithm to predict user ratings for films. The grand prize was $1,000,000 and was won by BellKor\'s Pragmatic Chaos team. This is the dataset that was used in that competition.       Content     **This comes directly from the README:**      TRAINING DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION    ================================================================================     The file ""training_set.tar"" is a tar of a directory containing 17770 files, one    per movie.  The first line of each file contains the movie id followed by a    colon.  Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer    and its date in the following format:     CustomerID,Rating,Date     - MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.    - CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.    - Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.    - Dates have the format YYYY-MM-DD.     MOVIES FILE DESCRIPTION    ================================================================================     Movie information in ""movie_titles.txt"" is in the following format:     MovieID,YearOfRelease,Title     - MovieID do not correspond to actual Netflix movie ids or IMDB movie ids.    - YearOfRelease can range from 1890 to 2005 and may correspond to the release of      corresponding DVD, not necessarily its theaterical release.    - Title is the Netflix movie title and may not correspond to       titles used on other sites.  Titles are in English.      QUALIFYING AND PREDICTION DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION    ================================================================================     The qualifying dataset for the Netflix Prize is contained in the text file    ""qualifying.txt"".  It consists of lines indicating a movie id, followed by a    colon, and then customer ids and rating dates, one per line for that movie id.    The movie and customer ids are contained in the training set.  Of course the    ratings are withheld. There are no empty lines in the file.     MovieID1:     CustomerID11,Date11     CustomerID12,Date12     ...     MovieID2:     CustomerID21,Date21     CustomerID22,Date22     For the Netflix Prize, your program must predict the all ratings the customers    gave the movies in the qualifying dataset based on the information in the    training dataset.     The format of your submitted prediction file follows the movie and customer id,    date order of the qualifying dataset.  However, your predicted rating takes the    place of the corresponding customer id (and date), one per line.     For example, if the qualifying dataset looked like:     111:     3245,2005-12-19     5666,2005-12-23     6789,2005-03-14     225:     1234,2005-05-26     3456,2005-11-07     then a prediction file should look something like:     111:     3.0     3.4     4.0     225:     1.0     2.0      which predicts that customer 3245 would have rated movie 111 3.0 stars on the    19th of Decemeber, 2005, that customer 5666 would have rated it slightly higher    at 3.4 stars on the 23rd of Decemeber, 2005, etc.     You must make predictions for all customers for all movies in the qualifying    dataset.     THE PROBE DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION    ================================================================================     To allow you to test your system before you submit a prediction set based on the    qualifying dataset, we have provided a probe dataset in the file ""probe.txt"".    This text file contains lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and    then customer ids, one per line for that movie id.     MovieID1:     CustomerID11     CustomerID12     ...     MovieID2:     CustomerID21     CustomerID22     Like the qualifying dataset, the movie and customer id pairs are contained in    the training set.  However, unlike the qualifying dataset, the ratings (and    dates) for each pair are contained in the training dataset.     If you wish, you may calculate the RMSE of your predictions against those    ratings and compare your RMSE against the Cinematch RMSE on the same data.  See    http://www.netflixprize.com/faqprobe for that value.       Acknowledgements     The training data came in 17,000+ files. In the interest of keeping files together and file sizes as low as possible, I combined them into four text files: combined_data_(1,2,3,4).txt       The contest was originally hosted at http://netflixprize.com/index.html     The dataset was downloaded from [https://archive.org/download/nf_prize_dataset.tar][1]      Inspiration     This is a fun dataset to work with.

There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).      Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.      For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/DSKG/dataset/588,Arabic Handwritten Digits Dataset," Arabic Handwritten Digits Dataset      Abstract    In recent years, handwritten digits recognition has been an important area    due to its applications in several fields. This work is focusing on the recognition    part of handwritten Arabic digits recognition that face several challenges, including    the unlimited variation in human handwriting and the large public databases. The    paper provided a deep learning technique that can be effectively apply to recognizing Arabic handwritten digits. LeNet-5, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)    trained and tested MADBase database (Arabic handwritten digits images) that contain 60000 training and 10000 testing images. A comparison is held amongst the    results, and it is shown by the end that the use of CNN was leaded to significant    improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms.     The Convolutional Neural Network was trained and tested MADBase database (Arabic handwritten digits images) that contain 60000 training and 10000 testing images. Moreover, the CNN is giving an average recognition accuracy of 99.15%.       Context    The motivation of this study is to use cross knowledge learned from multiple works to enhancement the performance of Arabic handwritten digits recognition. In recent years, Arabic handwritten digits recognition with different handwriting styles as well, making it important to find and work on a new and advanced solution for handwriting recognition. A deep learning systems needs a huge number of data (images) to be able to make a good decisions.       Content     The MADBase is modified Arabic handwritten digits database contains 60,000 training images, and 10,000 test images. MADBase were written by 700 writers. Each writer wrote each digit (from 0 -9) ten times. To ensure including different writing styles, the database was gathered from different institutions: Colleges of Engineering and Law, School of Medicine, the Open University (whose students span a wide range of ages), a high school, and a governmental institution.     MADBase is available for free and can be downloaded from (http://datacenter.aucegypt.edu/shazeem/) .
